Here it is. The one you have been waiting for. Episode 8 of the DJ Cruze podcast otherwise known as &#8220;The Best of 2005 Mix&#8221;.  
I&#8217;ve got together my favourite tunes from 2005 and stuck them in a bite-sized downloadable MP3 for your listening pleasure. How good is that?

It&#8217;s a bit longer than normal and comes in at 73 minutes and 30 seconds. A nice fit for a CD if you want to listen to it in the car. Hopefully it won&#8217;t break my bandwidth limits too much!

Here is the tracklisting for this week&#8217;s show:

  * **Best of 2005 Mix** 
      * Lilâ€™ Love &#8211; Little Love ([Soul Avengerz][3] Mix) &#8211; Positiva

      * Discrete feat. Belle Erskine &#8211; Love Me (12&#8243; Mix) &#8211; [Tokyo Project][5]
      * Sex On Monday &#8211; Bring Back The Love (Hold Me Down) ([Soul Avengerz][3] Mix) &#8211; Oxyd / [Manifesto Records][6]
      * Supafly vs Fishbowl &#8211; Letâ€™s Get Down (Full Intention Club Mix) &#8211; [Eye Industries][7]

I&#8217;d like to thank you all for your support and love over the past few months. I&#8217;ve made lots of new friends from around the world and I&#8217;m looking forward to rocking your floors soon. I&#8217;d especially like to thank Bodo in Germany who has been hosting all of the MP3s for the past few months. Check out his web services [here][20].
