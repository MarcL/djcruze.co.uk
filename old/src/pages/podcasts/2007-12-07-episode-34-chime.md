As always, it&#8217;s been a while since the last DJ Cruze podcast but finally I&#8217;ve got a new one online and it&#8217;s packed with the funkiest house music and chunkiest electro tunes. This week&#8217;s Cruze classic is an absolute monster. Orbital&#8217;s classic &#8220;Chime&#8221; needed to be aired as I haven&#8217;t played it in ages but it&#8217;s one of the original tunes that got me into house music from my hip-hop roots. A killer tune from the Hartnoll boys and one that still reminds me of the old rave days in Manchester.

The audio quality is slightly different on this show as I&#8217;ve moved my studio around a bit and I&#8217;ve started using a new compressor. If you know how compressors are meant to sound then you might find this a bit harsher than the previous shows. I need to tweak some settings until I&#8217;m completely happy with it but it still sounds pretty good. Let me know if you think it sounds worse than before!
