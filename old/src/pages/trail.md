_This trail might be the last one she ever follows..._

The younger citizens of The Beck don’t know what awaits them when they make their Transfer. Kept in the dark, Minors are sheltered from the dangers that await them.

Cass is a risk taker. When she accepts a dare one night and disappears over the wall, she doesn’t stop to think about the consequences.

Porter worships Cass. Discovering her idol is going on a forbidden adventure, she can’t resist following her. But The Beck is filled with unknown hazards, and one thing quickly becomes clear: **if they haven’t made it back by the morning, they may never make it back at all.**
