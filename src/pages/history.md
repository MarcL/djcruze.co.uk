Manchester is in the house again at the Groove Club in Karlsruhe on 11th September 2010. I’ll be playing a mix of new tunes and some classic house and it’s going to be an awesome party. Make sure you get there early as it’s only a small venue. The address is:

Hope to see you all down there!

## Vibration Revival Party, Schmidts – 28th November 2009

![Flyer](/images/flyers/vibration.jpg)

I’ll be “back once again with the renegade master” at Schmidt’s in Wiesloch for another of their fabulous Vibration Revival parties. I can’t believe it’s been 15 years since I started DJing at Vibration! Expect plenty of old school tunes, scratching and Jaegermeister! All of my old records are finally out of storage so I’m going to try and find some old obscure tracks for you. Anything from hip-hop, acid house, breakbeat and banging house tunes. It’s going to be awesome! Make sure you get there early as the parties are normally packed! The address is:

Schmidts
RingstraÃŸe 6
69168 Wiesloch
Deutschland / Germany

The support DJs are the “Vibration Allstars” and I don’t know who they are yet but I’m sure we’ll have a blast together. See you all there!

And sorry for the late posting about this party but life has been a bit busy with the birth of my second child, a little girl called Amy! 🙂

## Vibration Revival Party, Schmidts – 7th March 2009

![Flyer](/images/flyers/djcruze_schmidts_flyer_march2009.jpg)

I’ve finally received the flyer for the Vibration Revival Party that I’m DJing at on March 7th 2009. Like the last gig at Schmidt’s, I’m going to be playing plenty of old house tunes from the acid house era up to the late 1990s. The last party was a lock out so make sure you get there early. Here’s where you’ll find Schmidt’s:

Schmidts
RingstraÃŸe 6
69168 Wiesloch
Deutschland / Germany

As always I’ll be helped by my two favourite German DJs Alex Harmony and Luke 45 and also the owner of Schmidt’s, Swen, who also goes by the name DJ Silversurfer. We’ll be rocking hard so I hope to see all of my German fans coming out to the party as it’s been a year since I was last over. Make sure you’re ready to party as the tunes with be big! Hopefully this time there will be less JÃ¤germeister though as I had a very bad hangover after last time!

## Vibration Revival Party, Schmidts – 23rd February February 2008

![Flyer](/images/flyers/vibration_revival1.jpg)

Finally I received some information about the party I’m DJing at on 23rd February 2008. It’s going to be an old school party with some of the funkiest house tracks from the 1990s. For those of you who aren’t from Germany, Vibration was a club in Germany where I DJed from 1994 until the late 90s. It was an awesome venue and we had some of the greatest parties there.

So come on down to:

Schmidts
RingstraÃŸe 6
69168 Wiesloch
Deutschland / Germany

for some funky old school house tunes. I’ll be helped by two good friends and great DJs, Alex Harmony and Luke 45 so expect plenty of madness and Jaegermeister!

## Loft Club, 14th April 2007

![Flyer](/images/flyers/cruze_loft0906_small.jpg)

I should have posted about this a long time ago but it took the people from the Loft Club so long to agree the gig that I completely forgot about it! So on Saturday 14th April 2007 I’ll be back in the Loft Club in Ludwigshafen playing some funky house, some dirty electro and a few “Manchester House” classics thrown in for good measure. Assisting me on the decks are Alex Harmony and Luke 45 and we’ll be rocking the back room for a change instead of the main room. I’m hoping this will be an intimate little party for the people who love quality house music. In the main room you’ll have M.A.N.D.Y. from Berlin’s Get Physical label and if tech-house and minimal techno is your thing then you’ll get that too.

So if you’re in Germany then get your ass down for some fantastic music and some good times!

## Loft Club, Saturday 30th September 2006

It’s that time again for me to return to one of my favourite clubs in Germany, The Loft Club in Ludwigshafen. I’m back on the decks with my main man DJ Vuish and we’ll be helping Alex Harmony to celebrate his birthday. Alex and my other main homeboy Luke45 will be mixing their dirty tech house too. So get your ass down to the club and you’ll hear some funky house music, some dirty electro and some cheeky Cruze classics in the mix. Get there early as the club is normally a lock out! You remember what happened when we rocked it last time?! (Yes, I’m trying to forget about when I DJ’ed in Lederhosen! Haha!)

## XTC Radio, Sunday 21st June 2006

If anyone fancies hearing me live in the mix then I’ll be filling in for my main man DJ Dyslexic on Sunday 21st June 2006 at 7 pm PST (which is 3 am BST on Monday 22nd June 2006). Dyslexic is away on holiday so I’ll be doing a 2 hour mix for his “Cure for the common Sunday” show on XTC Radio and hopefully doing him proud. Tune in via the website to hear the show live or subscribe to Dyslexic’s podcast feed. Enjoy!

## Last Exit Before Marriage @ The Loft Club, 2nd June 2006

As most of you know, I’m getting married in August 2006 and it is traditional for the groom to have a stag party (or bachelor party in the US or Junggesellenabschied in German.) Most men take their friends on a weekend of drunken debauchery and mine is no exception. However, for mine I’m actually DJ’ing for one evening if I can manage to stand up. So you are cordially invite to:

LAST EXIT BEFORE MARRIAGE
(aka DJ Cruze’s stag/bachelor/Junggesellenabschied)
Saturday 2nd June 2006
The Loft Club
Ludwigshafen
Germany

It’s going to be a wild party with plenty of funky house music, electro, “Manchester House” and more from myself, DJ Cruze, and my long-time DJ’ing partner DJ Vuish. We’ll be ably assisted by our good friends Alex Harmony and Luke45. If we can organise it then we’ll also be opening the back room for a special V.I.P. party with some of our Manchester friends DJ’ing.

Of course, the British boys will be coming too so look out for 16 of the North West of England’s finest drinkers! I’m looking forward to seeing the flyer as I have been stitched up by DJ Vuish (my best man) and my brother Matt. I’m loving the pictures of me as a small child and a teenager. What a geek! I’ll post the full flyer when I get it. Apparently I look cool with my iconic “Atari Pac-man” t-shirt on. I’m not sure I believe them though.

Here’s a translation of what’s happening from the Loft Club’s website:

> For more than 10 years they have been the heroes of our past and present. There is hardly anyone who doesn’t have a tape on which Mr Cruze screams: ‘Is anybody hammered!?’. (DJ Cruze: It was actually DJ Vuish who shouted this on the infamous tape (Milk Club, Mannheim – August 1993) in question but I don’t mind claiming responsibility.) And as is the case with heroes, in the end they save humanity, the captives, justice or the party people and still get the girl. That must be celebrated! DJ Vuish, who in recent years has become a rare guest, is travelling solely for this occasion back to good old Germany to present his prodigal son speech in musical form. (DJ Cruze: Yes, it really says this!!) For this opportunity he is dragging half of Manchester with him, for much has been heard of Loft there. Naturally the two good old friends from their second home will not be missing. Alex Harmony and Luke 45 will be providing local support and will be releasing him from the single life in the most meaningful way possible. Shortly before we succumb to World Cup fever, let us succumb once again to the heroes of the past. We’re looking forward to this so much and offer our most sincere congratulations. Friends – this is one not to be missed! Oh and by the way, ladies: now or never…

Hopefully we’ll see all of my German friends there so keep this weekend free. It’s going to get hot in the Loft Club and you’re all invited. And yes ladies. It really is now or never! 😉

Thanks to Kev for correcting my German!
