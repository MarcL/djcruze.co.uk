It's about time I gave you another old mix isn't it?  
My bandwidth may be taking a battering with my podcast show but I know that you all like the old mixes.

Here is a CD mix I did back in the winter of 1997 called &#8220;Post Modern Sleaze&#8221;. It's named after the song of the same name by [The Sneaker Pimps][1]. As anyone who has heard me DJ will know, the [Matthew Roberts][2] (aka Phunk Force who now records as King Unique) mix is a classic that I often play. Enjoy the mix and let me know what you think.

**Tracklisting:**

  1. Hoof – Detroit
  2. Sneaker Pimps – Post Modern Sleaze (The Phunk Force Mix)
  3. De'Lacey – Hideaway (187 Lockdown Mix)
  4. 187 Lockdown – Gunman
  5. DJ Supreme vs Rhythm Masters – Enter The Scene (Klubheads Mix)
  6. Urban Shakedown – Some Justice
  7. Jimmy Ray – Are You Jimmy Ray? (Lisa Marie Experience Mix)
  8. Wildchild – Renegade Master (Fatboy Slim New Skool Mix)
  9. TBA – Never Give Up On
 10. Laguna – Spiller From Rio (+ accapella of Fatima Rainey &#8220;Love is a Wonderful Thing&#8221;)
 11. Kinane – Business (K-Klass Club Mix)
 12. Sybil – Why? (Mark's Non-Stop Dub)

Oh and Happy Halloween too! Next year I'll have to make a spooky mix for it!
