It's about time I gave you another old mix isn't it?  
My bandwidth may be taking a battering with my podcast show but I know that you all like the old mixes.

Here is a CD mix I did back in the winter of 1997 called &#8220;Post Modern Sleaze&#8221;. It's named after the song of the same name by [The Sneaker Pimps][1]. As anyone who has heard me DJ will know, the [Matthew Roberts][2] (aka Phunk Force who now records as King Unique) mix is a classic that I often play. Enjoy the mix and let me know what you think.
