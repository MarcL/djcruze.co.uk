Another DJ Cruze old mix is online! It&#8217;s only from 2002 but it&#8217;s a good one (&#8230;well I like it anyway!). Apologies that I can&#8217;t remember the name of every tune that is on there. I tend to just put tunes into the mix and not remember the name of them. I&#8217;ve got far too many white labels and promos with vague titles on them but I&#8217;ll try and find out the names for you in case you want to buy them. If you know the names of the tunes that I&#8217;ve forgotten then [get in touch][1]. I hope you enjoy the mix. Yes, I have put S-Club 7 in the mix. Don&#8217;t hate me! It&#8217;s a great funky remix from Harry &#8220;Choo Choo&#8221; Romero! ðŸ˜ƒ

I&#8217;m still having problems with my webhost so you&#8217;ll get some other mixes from the 90s really soon. As you saw from the picture of my box full of tapes I have a lot to upload for you. How about one a month? Or maybe two if you&#8217;re really lucky! Also, the podcast will be online by Wednesday 18th January too as long as the webhost issues have stopped! As I mentioned last week I have got provisions for moving it to a new host so I&#8217;ll sort that out this week and the FTP access problems should go away.
