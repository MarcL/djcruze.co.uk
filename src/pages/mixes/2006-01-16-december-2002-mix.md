Another DJ Cruze old mix is online! It's only from 2002 but it's a good one (...well I like it anyway!). Apologies that I can't remember the name of every tune that is on there. I tend to just put tunes into the mix and not remember the name of them. I've got far too many white labels and promos with vague titles on them but I'll try and find out the names for you in case you want to buy them. If you know the names of the tunes that I've forgotten then [get in touch][1]. I hope you enjoy the mix. Yes, I have put S-Club 7 in the mix. Don't hate me! It's a great funky remix from Harry "Choo Choo" Romero! 😃

I'm still having problems with my webhost so you'll get some other mixes from the 90s really soon. As you saw from the picture of my box full of tapes I have a lot to upload for you. How about one a month? Or maybe two if you're really lucky! Also, the podcast will be online by Wednesday 18th January too as long as the webhost issues have stopped! As I mentioned last week I have got provisions for moving it to a new host so I'll sort that out this week and the FTP access problems should go away.
