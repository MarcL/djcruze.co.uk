Today I'm celebrating my 34th birthday (yes, I'm really that old!) Well, strictly speaking I did a lot of celebrating last night and hence I have a rather sore head today. If you're ever in the Manchester area then check out a great little cocktail bar called [Socio Rehab][1] in Manchester's Northern Quarter. It's an awesome, dark and dingy little bar that does fantastic cocktails. Plenty of fun was had by everyone and our wallets are a lot emptier for their London-style drinks prices!

Anyway, what better cure for a hangover than to make a funky house music mix for you guys. Hopefully I can hold the mixing together.

**Tracklisting:**

1. Tony Cha Cha vs Mark Simmons – Somebody Else (Rockefella Dub) – Spinnin'
2. Soul Avengerz – Love You Feel – Opaque Music
3. High Life feat. Karime Kendra – Mercy On Me (Main Mix) – Onephatdeeva

It's in a nice CD-burnable 128kbps MP3 which has a running time of around 70 minutes. So download it, burn it to a CD and play it LOUD! Happy Birthday from me to you! <img src="http://www.djcruze.co.uk/cms/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
