So as promised on podcast #19, here is an electro mix for you. I actually managed to do the mix before I got married but didn't have time to upload it! I thought I'd do something a bit different for you this time and do a twisted electro-house mix. I've picked up a few dirty tracks, remixes and dubs that I thought went well together so here you go. It's not my normal style of music as I normally play the funkier side of house music. Some of the tunes I am playing now are heading in this direction though so I'm sure you'll love it.

The mix starts off with some fine 80s synth pop from Shena and drops into the dirty groover that is Mark Knight's "Insatiable". It then builds up through the massive "Easy" from Germany's Trick & Kubik, the acid anthem that is Fedde Le Grand's "Put Your Hands Up For Detroit" (...go on, put your hands up!) and onto the dirty bassline monster that is "Release" by clubland's golden boy of the moment Chris Lake. Think 2am in the dirtiest club you can think of! It then heads off into dirty disco with Spiller's "Jumbo", tracky beats from Switch with his remix of Kelis' "Bossy" and then through 80s vibes from Jaymo and Hauswerks, Lo-Rider and Michael Gray. We get all international at the end of the mix with the fantastic "Moonlight Party" from Italy's Fonzerelli and then the French sounds of the Lifelike mix of Geyster's "Under The Fuse Of Love".

I hope you enjoy this one and make sure you let me know what you think in the comments section below. Do you guys and girls want more dirty electro house as well as the funky stuff?
