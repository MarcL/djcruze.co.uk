So as promised on podcast #19, here is an electro mix for you. I actually managed to do the mix before I got married but didn&#8217;t have time to upload it! I thought I&#8217;d do something a bit different for you this time and do a twisted electro-house mix. I&#8217;ve picked up a few dirty tracks, remixes and dubs that I thought went well together so here you go. It&#8217;s not my normal style of music as I normally play the funkier side of house music. Some of the tunes I am playing now are heading in this direction though so I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll love it.

The mix starts off with some fine 80s synth pop from Shena and drops into the dirty groover that is Mark Knight&#8217;s &#8220;Insatiable&#8221;. It then builds up through the massive &#8220;Easy&#8221; from Germany&#8217;s Trick &#038; Kubik, the acid anthem that is Fedde Le Grand&#8217;s &#8220;Put Your Hands Up For Detroit&#8221; (&#8230;go on, put your hands up!) and onto the dirty bassline monster that is &#8220;Release&#8221; by clubland&#8217;s golden boy of the moment [Chris Lake][1]. Think 2am in the dirtiest club you can think of! It then heads off into dirty disco with Spiller&#8217;s &#8220;Jumbo&#8221;, tracky beats from Switch with his remix of Kelis&#8217; &#8220;Bossy&#8221; and then through 80s vibes from Jaymo and Hauswerks, Lo-Rider and Michael Gray. We get all international at the end of the mix with the fantastic &#8220;Moonlight Party&#8221; from Italy&#8217;s Fonzerelli and then the French sounds of the Lifelike mix of Geyster&#8217;s &#8220;Under The Fuse Of Love&#8221;.
