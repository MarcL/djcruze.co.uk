The first mix in my Christmas mini-mix series brings you a warm up mix. It&#8217;s 10pm. You haven&#8217;t left the house yet but you want some tunes to get you in the mood. What do you do? Turn on your PC (or your CD player if you&#8217;ve ripped this mix) and turn up the funky warm up mix!

Kicking off the mix is Dutch producer [Mischa Daniels][1] with his funky &#8220;Take Me Higher&#8221;. Sweden&#8217;s master producer [Stonebridge][2] remixes this and gives us a funky bassline, some mellow keys and a great start to the mix. After this we&#8217;ve got the emotive piano mix of [Just Jack][3]&#8216;s &#8220;Starz in their Eyes&#8221; by The [Trophy Twins][4]. It takes a bit of getting used to if you&#8217;re not used to his urban poetry style (think [The Streets][5] but a bit more musical when he sings) but I&#8217;m loving this remix. Reminds me of the early 90s deep house stuff that I used to love.

I&#8217;ve then stuck in one of my tunes of the year. I&#8217;m obviously a massive fan of [Raul Rincon][6], just check out my [charts][7], and he has turned &#8220;Life Begins&#8221; by [The Energies][8] into an amazing piano tune. The electric pianos and reversed vocals build up the tune nicely until he drops his killer piano riff. Lovely work! I could listen to this tune on repeat all day. Well maybe not all day but at least for a couple of hours! It&#8217;s a pity his website insists on opening full screen though!

Following that we have a funky tune from some new UK producers called [Kingpinz][9] with their new track &#8220;Need You Tonight&#8221;. Some funky pads and a chunky bassline give this a place in my box. Finally, we&#8217;ve got one of the hottest production teams of 2006 &#8211; [The Soul Seekerz][10]. They&#8217;ve had a fantastic year, with what seems like hundreds of remixes, and &#8220;Party For The Weekend&#8221; tops it off nicely for them.

So there you go. The first Christmas mini-mix. Hope you enjoyed it and keep your eyes on the website for the next mix in a couple of days.
