The first mix in my Christmas mini-mix series brings you a warm up mix. It's 10pm. You haven't left the house yet but you want some tunes to get you in the mood. What do you do? Turn on your PC (or your CD player if you've ripped this mix) and turn up the funky warm up mix!

Kicking off the mix is Dutch producer [Mischa Daniels][1] with his funky "Take Me Higher". Sweden's master producer [Stonebridge][2] remixes this and gives us a funky bassline, some mellow keys and a great start to the mix. After this we've got the emotive piano mix of [Just Jack][3]'s "Starz in their Eyes" by The [Trophy Twins][4]. It takes a bit of getting used to if you're not used to his urban poetry style (think [The Streets][5] but a bit more musical when he sings) but I'm loving this remix. Reminds me of the early 90s deep house stuff that I used to love.

I've then stuck in one of my tunes of the year. I'm obviously a massive fan of [Raul Rincon][6], just check out my [charts][7], and he has turned "Life Begins" by [The Energies][8] into an amazing piano tune. The electric pianos and reversed vocals build up the tune nicely until he drops his killer piano riff. Lovely work! I could listen to this tune on repeat all day. Well maybe not all day but at least for a couple of hours! It's a pity his website insists on opening full screen though!

Following that we have a funky tune from some new UK producers called [Kingpinz][9] with their new track "Need You Tonight". Some funky pads and a chunky bassline give this a place in my box. Finally, we've got one of the hottest production teams of 2006 – [The Soul Seekerz][10]. They've had a fantastic year, with what seems like hundreds of remixes, and "Party For The Weekend" tops it off nicely for them.

So there you go. The first Christmas mini-mix. Hope you enjoyed it and keep your eyes on the website for the next mix in a couple of days.
