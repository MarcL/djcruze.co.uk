Time for the second DJ Cruze Christmas mini-mix and what better way to work off all of the extra Christmas food that you&#8217;ve eaten than with a dirty electro mix. This mix starts off with the dirty electro [Speaker Junk][1] remix of [Basement Jaxx][2]&#8216;s &#8220;Take Me Back To Your House&#8221;. It sound like one of the dubbier mixes that the Jaxx boys used to do of their own tunes and it sounds awesome in a club.

I&#8217;ve then stuck a tune which I originally hated but then grew to love after I heard it in a mix that someone gave me. It&#8217;s by a Dutch hip-hop collective called D.J.V.T. and it has been transformed into an 8-bit wonder by one of my favourite DJs, and ex-Wise Guy, [DJ Touche][3]. Layered with booming synth basslines and 8-bit synth stabs this works really well for my harder dancefloors. I&#8217;ve got no idea what the lyrics are though! Perhaps one of my Dutch fans can tell me.

Continuing the hip-house and Dutch theme we&#8217;ve then got [Don Diablo][4]&#8216;s &#8220;Blow&#8221; as remixed by another hot Dutch DJ and producer [Sebastien Leger][5]. Sebastien has been on a roll this year and his dirty electro tunes rip the dancefloors up. This is followed up by another hot remix by Sebastien with his wicked acid-tinged remix of [Lorraine][6]&#8216;s &#8220;Heaven&#8221;. Filtered electro at its best!

We&#8217;ve then got something unexpected. Yes, the dulcet tones of Mick Hucknall and [Simply Red][7]! Sweet Connection have turned this into a killer tune by minimal use of the vocals and some great building synths. This is followed by a horrible cheesy tune in its original form but Dave Moreaux has turned the Michael Jackson remake of &#8220;Billie Jean&#8221; by Starzoom into a chunky and glitchy electro tune. I&#8217;m loving this remix of it.

Finally, we&#8217;ve got a fantastic production and remix of [Scissor Sisters][8] &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Feel Like Dancing&#8221; by Paper Faces aka Mr. Stuart Price, Les Rhythmes Digitals, Jacques Lu Cont, Thin White Duke, Man With Guitar etc. A man of many guises but an excellent producer as Madonna will attest I&#8217;m sure. Using repetitive vocal snippets, great pads and a cheeky square-waved synth bassline this is a great tune to end the mix.
