Time for the second DJ Cruze Christmas mini-mix and what better way to work off all of the extra Christmas food that you've eaten than with a dirty electro mix. This mix starts off with the dirty electro [Speaker Junk][1] remix of [Basement Jaxx][2]'s "Take Me Back To Your House". It sound like one of the dubbier mixes that the Jaxx boys used to do of their own tunes and it sounds awesome in a club.

I've then stuck a tune which I originally hated but then grew to love after I heard it in a mix that someone gave me. It's by a Dutch hip-hop collective called D.J.V.T. and it has been transformed into an 8-bit wonder by one of my favourite DJs, and ex-Wise Guy, [DJ Touche][3]. Layered with booming synth basslines and 8-bit synth stabs this works really well for my harder dancefloors. I've got no idea what the lyrics are though! Perhaps one of my Dutch fans can tell me.

Continuing the hip-house and Dutch theme we've then got [Don Diablo][4]'s "Blow" as remixed by another hot Dutch DJ and producer [Sebastien Leger][5]. Sebastien has been on a roll this year and his dirty electro tunes rip the dancefloors up. This is followed up by another hot remix by Sebastien with his wicked acid-tinged remix of [Lorraine][6]'s "Heaven". Filtered electro at its best!

We've then got something unexpected. Yes, the dulcet tones of Mick Hucknall and [Simply Red][7]! Sweet Connection have turned this into a killer tune by minimal use of the vocals and some great building synths. This is followed by a horrible cheesy tune in its original form but Dave Moreaux has turned the Michael Jackson remake of "Billie Jean" by Starzoom into a chunky and glitchy electro tune. I'm loving this remix of it.

Finally, we've got a fantastic production and remix of [Scissor Sisters][8] "I Don't Feel Like Dancing" by Paper Faces aka Mr. Stuart Price, Les Rhythmes Digitals, Jacques Lu Cont, Thin White Duke, Man With Guitar etc. A man of many guises but an excellent producer as Madonna will attest I'm sure. Using repetitive vocal snippets, great pads and a cheeky square-waved synth bassline this is a great tune to end the mix.
