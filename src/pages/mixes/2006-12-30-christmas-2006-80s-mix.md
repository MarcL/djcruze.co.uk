If you had to describe the sound of 2006 then I'd probably say that it was the year of the 80s bassline. Synthesizers came back into fashion and the bouncing saw-toothed bassline came back into vogue. This little mini-mix celebrates the sound of 2006 while still keeping the funky vibe that you all know and love.

Kicking off this mix is a remix from two of the hottest Dutch producers of the last year, Mark Simmons and [Dennis Christopher][1]. They do a great remix on [Paris Avenue][2]&#8216;s &#8220;In My Mind&#8221; and build up the tune with a bouncing bassline, some funky guitars and a cheeky arpeggiated synth. Following that we've got possibly the best remix, in my opinion, of Degrees of Motion's classic &#8220;Do You Want It Right Now?&#8221; The hottest producers of 2006, [Seamus Haji][3] and Paul Emanuel, take us back to the late 80s or early 90s with their synth driven piano remix and this track blew up big time for me in the clubs.

M-Factor then take on the mighty [Fatboy Slim][4] to give us a funky synth bassline version of his hip-hop reggae tune &#8220;Champion Sound&#8221;. A massive, building tune that takes us neatly to [Kurtis Mantronix][5]&#8216;s re-rub of &#8220;We Ride&#8221; by Rihanna. A dirty D-Ramirez style tune with some bleepy 80s 8-bit synth noises that really works the dirty dancefloors when played out in a club.

We then head back to another Haji &#038; Emanuel remix and their reworking of &#8220;Easy&#8221; by the Sugababes. Following a similar style to the Mantronix remix it features plenty of reverb and de-tuned synth fun and cheeky cut-up vocals. We finish the 80s mix with a cheeky 80s tune which has been brought into the 2000s by a producer called Edison. I couldn't resist dropping his remix of &#8220;Heart Of Glass&#8221; by [Blondie][6] into the mix as it wouldn't be the 80s without a bit of Blondie! It's very similar to the original but adds some funky house drums and cuts up the tune a bit. A cheeky rework if ever there was one.
