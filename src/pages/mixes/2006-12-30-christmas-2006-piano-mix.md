I love piano house. It's that simple. I first got into it in the early 90s when house music moved from the synthesizer based acid house and early techno that people were producing into the Italian &"Italo-house" that unsurprisingly came out of Italy! There were hundreds of great tunes that came out and they helped to move the house sound on from bleepy techno to a more soulful sound. A play a lot of funky piano house in my sets so I thought I'd try and play some of the great piano tunes that have come out in 2006.

This mix kicks off with a great tune by French producer [Antoine Clamaran][1]. The funky American remix team [Hott 22][2] build up this soulful tune with some pumping keys combined with the smooth vocal and a some layered pads and strings. We then head off into old school piano territory for Mike Perry's remix of &"Brazilian Love Affair" by [George Duke][3]. A classic old jazz tune that builds up into a big room tune where the pianos echo round your head forever!

We've then got the funky house sounds of the producer of the year, [Raul Rincon][4]. He turns &"Be Without You" by Wi-Fi into a percussion-laden piano anthem. The pianos remind me of the old hardcore classic &"Feel Reel Good" by [Manix][5] which was later got sampled by Rockford Files for their 1994 club hit &"Sexy Dancer". Raul Rincon has the midas touch when it comes to remix and I'm sure he'll carry on into 2007 with his funky house sounds.

Hot Spanish producer [Ian Carey][6] then takes on the hot German producers the [Tune Brothers][7] and their awesome old school sounding &"I Like It". Ian provides us with a dirty 2006 bassline but kicks in some nagging piano keys which just seem to build and build. This is a proper 2am tune which sends the crowds wild. I've then put in Simmons and [Christopher][8]&#8216;s new tune &"Weekend". This is a cover of an old disco anthem by Class Action which was made famous by [Todd Terry][9] in the early 90s. Again Raul Rincon works his remix magic and drops a funky bassline, chunky rhodes and pianos and a cheeky synth lead line. Another classic remix from the wunderkind of German house!

The final tune in the piano mix is a new tune by Cafe Groove called &"Why U Wanna Do Me Wrong?". A great soulful remix by the [Soul Avengerz][10] ends the mix nicely as they create a future piano anthem. Lovely!
