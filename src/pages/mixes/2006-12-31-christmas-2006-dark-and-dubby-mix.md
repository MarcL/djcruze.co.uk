So for the 5th mini mix of Christmas we have something deep, dark and dubby. Imagine it's 4am in a club and you've had way too much of your favourite substance (mine is beer but yours might be something else!) What do you need? Some deep and dirty grooves to chill you out a bit of course!

Kicking this mix off is the stunning remix of Dannii Minogue's "He's The Greatest Dancer" by Scottish producer of the moment [Chris Lake][1]. Chris builds the track with a deep and dubby bassline and cheeky start-stop drums interspersed with Dannii's great vocals and some haunting strings. This mix is a million miles away from the somewhat cheesey original mix.

[Eddie Thoneick][2] then takes it up a notch with his remix of "Feel Together" by Ben Macklin. He has turned this into an electro-house stomper from the original's orchestral feel. Featuring great vocals from Tiger Lilly this builds up into a dirty monster of a tune. We then head through The Group Dynamics "Consequences" with its clanging synths and chugging bassline through to an unsual remix of Robbie William's "Lovelight". Kurd Maverick loses most of the vocals and just keeps a few repetitive phrases that he layers over chunky drums, nagging synths and a funky electronic bassline. Add a smattering of funky wah-wah guitars and you've got a killer tune.

Next up we've got a cheeky tune from [The Young Punx][3] called "Rockall". It samples a UK radio station called [Radio 4][4] which is one of the BBC's premier radio stations. During the evening we have something called the [shipping forecast][5] which tells sailors the weather forecast and sailing conditions around the UK. The Young Punx have cheekily sampled it to create this funky breakbeat tune "Rockall". Something I didn't know is that rockall is a stretch of the Atlantic just off the west coast of Ireland and appears to be prone to gales at this time of year! Now don't say that I don't teach you anything.

Klaas then does a nice and dirty remix of "Weightlessness" from [Freelance Hellraiser][6]. If you've never heard of him then think again. He was the original king of the mash-up and you've probably heard his version of "Genie in a Bottle" by Christina Aguilera over the top of The Strokes' "Hard To Explain". A genius if ever I heard one. He's back with a new album and if this is anything to go by then it's going to rock hard!

Finally, we end on a dirty [Dave Spoon][7] remix of Tyken's "Every Word" on Hed Kandi. They've done a little side-step from their usual funky releases with this EP and they've moved into the 80s synth house. Dave's remix heads down the saw-synth bassline route with is complemented by the great vocals in this tune. It feels mellow but it rocks hard!

Hope you enjoyed the deep and dubby mix and watch out for the final mix in the Christmas mini-mix series.
