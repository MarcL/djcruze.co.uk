To finish off this series of Christmas mini-mixes I decided to mix a few of my favourite funky tunes from the past few months. Kicking off the mix we have a funky little number from [the Jaxx][1] called &#8220;Hush Boy&#8221;. The [Soul Seekerz ][2]have transformed it from a downbeat tune into a funky house number which rocked many of my funky floors last year. We then move onto a mysterious reggae house tune called &#8220;Why?&#8221; by Lucky 7. I still haven&#8217;t found out who did this tune but I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s one of the big house producers of the moment and they couldn&#8217;t clear the samples! It&#8217;s a funky little number in the same vein as [Olav Basoski][3]&#8216;s &#8220;Waterman&#8221; and it rocks!

We&#8217;ve then got the classic cut-up disco tune &#8220;Everytime&#8221; by Sexy Toy on the Italian label [Oryx Music][4]. It takes me back to the original cut-up disco house revolution that happened during the mid 90s. There&#8217;s not enough cut-up disco any more but that&#8217;s probably because most of the obvious samples have been used already! Moving on we&#8217;ve got the excellent Dirty Old Ann with &#8220;Turn Me On&#8221;. It&#8217;s another remake of the Kathy Brown classic but yet again used to good effect in this funky version.

I&#8217;ve then dropped a very cheeky tune by Manchester&#8217;s [Mint Royale][5]. They&#8217;ve sampled &#8220;Wham Rap&#8221; by [Wham][6] and made it into a cheeky piano driven breakbeat tune. This one works well with the party crowds and I love playing it out when I can. We then head off to [Seamus Haji][7]&#8216;s cheeky bootleg remix of [Tweet][8]&#8216;s &#8220;Boogie Tonight&#8221; (but now with a re-recorded vocal and known as Bootie Luv). This was a massive track for me a few years ago when I played the [DB Boulevard][9] Club Mix. This hard to get hold of remix from Seamus Haji was originally on promos back in 2003 but it was finally re-released as a &#8220;new&#8221; remix on Hed Kandi a few months ago. It&#8217;s a massive track and ends a great year of production and remixing for Mr. Haji.

The final tune on the mix comes from [Hed Kandi][10] again and they&#8217;ve just released this chunky tune from Tyken called &#8220;Every Word&#8221;. This remix isn&#8217;t as dirty as the original but it has a great synth breakdown and it rocks any dancefloor. Look out for more great tunes from the Hed Kandi guys in the new year.

So that&#8217;s it. The last of the Christmas mini-mixes. I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed them all and I look forward to doing plenty more in 2007.
