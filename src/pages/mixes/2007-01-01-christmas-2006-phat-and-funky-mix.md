To finish off this series of Christmas mini-mixes I decided to mix a few of my favourite funky tunes from the past few months. Kicking off the mix we have a funky little number from [the Jaxx][1] called "Hush Boy". The [Soul Seekerz ][2]have transformed it from a downbeat tune into a funky house number which rocked many of my funky floors last year. We then move onto a mysterious reggae house tune called "Why?" by Lucky 7. I still haven't found out who did this tune but I'm guessing it's one of the big house producers of the moment and they couldn't clear the samples! It's a funky little number in the same vein as [Olav Basoski][3]'s "Waterman" and it rocks!

We've then got the classic cut-up disco tune "Everytime" by Sexy Toy on the Italian label [Oryx Music][4]. It takes me back to the original cut-up disco house revolution that happened during the mid 90s. There's not enough cut-up disco any more but that's probably because most of the obvious samples have been used already! Moving on we've got the excellent Dirty Old Ann with "Turn Me On". It's another remake of the Kathy Brown classic but yet again used to good effect in this funky version.

I've then dropped a very cheeky tune by Manchester's [Mint Royale][5]. They've sampled "Wham Rap" by [Wham][6] and made it into a cheeky piano driven breakbeat tune. This one works well with the party crowds and I love playing it out when I can. We then head off to [Seamus Haji][7]'s cheeky bootleg remix of [Tweet][8]'s "Boogie Tonight" (but now with a re-recorded vocal and known as Bootie Luv). This was a massive track for me a few years ago when I played the [DB Boulevard][9] Club Mix. This hard to get hold of remix from Seamus Haji was originally on promos back in 2003 but it was finally re-released as a "new" remix on Hed Kandi a few months ago. It's a massive track and ends a great year of production and remixing for Mr. Haji.

The final tune on the mix comes from [Hed Kandi][10] again and they've just released this chunky tune from Tyken called "Every Word". This remix isn't as dirty as the original but it has a great synth breakdown and it rocks any dancefloor. Look out for more great tunes from the Hed Kandi guys in the new year.

So that's it. The last of the Christmas mini-mixes. I hope you've enjoyed them all and I look forward to doing plenty more in 2007.
