title: August 2007 Mix
author: djcruze
excerpt: |
  It's been quite a while since I've posted a new mix and any new podcasts. As you all know, my new baby is keeping me rather busy but I have managed to make an hour to mix up a filthy, electro monster of a mix! I've got no time to do shout-outs for the podcast so I thought I'd add it to the podcast feed instead. So get the mix downloaded and play it loud!

It&#8217;s been quite a while since I&#8217;ve posted a new mix and any new podcasts. As you all know, my new baby is keeping me rather busy but I have managed to make an hour to mix up a filthy, electro monster of a mix! I&#8217;ve got no time to do shout-outs for the podcast so I thought I&#8217;d add it to the podcast RSS feed instead. There are loads of great tracks in the mix here. I&#8217;m loving the Dave Spoon remix of Andrea Doria&#8217;s &#8220;Freak Me&#8221; and the Jack Rokka vs Betty Boo track &#8220;Take Off&#8221;. Both great electro tracks to get you rocking.
