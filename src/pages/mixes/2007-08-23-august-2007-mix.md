title: August 2007 Mix

excerpt: |
  It's been quite a while since I've posted a new mix and any new podcasts. As you all know, my new baby is keeping me rather busy but I have managed to make an hour to mix up a filthy, electro monster of a mix! I've got no time to do shout-outs for the podcast so I thought I'd add it to the podcast feed instead. So get the mix downloaded and play it loud!

It's been quite a while since I've posted a new mix and any new podcasts. As you all know, my new baby is keeping me rather busy but I have managed to make an hour to mix up a filthy, electro monster of a mix! I've got no time to do shout-outs for the podcast so I thought I'd add it to the podcast RSS feed instead. There are loads of great tracks in the mix here. I'm loving the Dave Spoon remix of Andrea Doria's "Freak Me" and the Jack Rokka vs Betty Boo track "Take Off". Both great electro tracks to get you rocking.
