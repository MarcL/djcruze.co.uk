Don&#8217;t you hate being full of a cold? I do and the only way to combat it is with a dose of funky house music. Ok, well I&#8217;m sure a doctor might just prescribe paracetamol and plenty of water and rest but this is Dr. DJ Cruze talking! I prescribe funky music for most things!

I decided to go for something a little less commercial and add more vocals to the mix this time. I&#8217;ve not done a funky mix in a while so I thought I&#8217;d give you a nice little warm up mix. Stick it on before you go out or perhaps when you get back in after a big night out and enjoy the funky vibes. I know it&#8217;s unfashionable to admit it but I love the Simply Red track. Grant Nelson gives us a fantastic dub version with only sparse use of Mick Hucknall&#8217;s soulful voice. Sometimes it&#8217;s better just to judge a track on merit and not think about who the track is actually by!
