It's been an awfully long time since I put a new mix onto my site so I managed to grab a couple of hours the other night and thought I'd do a new mix ready for my trip to Ibiza on Saturday. I'm off on a stag/bachelor weekend with some of the guys from Manchester and because the stag, Will, is a big fan of progressive house I thought I'd do a deep, dark and progressive mix for us to play while we're out there. Obviously I thought you guys might like it too so here it is! I must warn you that it's not my normal style and it gets a bit dark and twisted! It runs a fine line between electro, progressive and tech house but it'll definitely get you in the mood for going out!

The mix kicks of with the king of electro house music, Mr. Eric Prydz and his homage to a Stockholm club called "F12" (...well, having just read an interview with him where he says it's a favourite club of his, I'm assuming that's why.) We've then got an exclusive tune from a soon-to-be-famous-I-hope Dutch producer [Duart Jansen][2] called "2 Cowboys" which is absolutely rocking. Then we head through a wicked Deamau5 remix of Mike Di Scala and on to a tough, jacking remix of Dave Spoon's "88" by Mark Knight and Funkagenda.

Up next is another cheeky tune which is unfortunately doing the rounds on the internet but is too good not to play. I'm hoping Eric Prydz releases "Fabric Test" (which I assume was a test tune when he was playing at Fabric!) so that I can buy it but it doesn't seem to be turning up on any of the legal download sites. It's a wicked dark, electro track will sound huge in a club. I've then got a fantastic new electro house version of one of my favourite trance tracks, Three Drives - "Greece 2000". Following that is an exclusive remix by the Funkfinders, otherwise known as DJ Cruze (yes, me!), on Alex Harmony's "Nayati". It's a tougher remix than I'd normally do but I wanted to do something a bit different. It's got chunky beats, a full on bassline and some massively crushed strings. Hope you like it! I'll speak to Alex and hopefully I can put it on my website for you to download as it hasn't been included in the final release. Let me know in the comments if you'd like to download it.

Moving on from my remix we've got a killer Deadmau5 sounding track from Dobenbeck and then onto Axwell's Remode version of Adele's "Hometown Glory". I know I just played it on the [last podcast][3] but I love the pianos in it so I couldn't help but put this version in the mix. Seemlessly mixing into that we've got "555" from the other members of the Swedish House Mafia, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso. This track almost has a techno feel to it but I think it's just the right side of funky electro house for my taste. Finally we've got a massive breakdown with EDX's "Premiumline" and onto the a jacking new tune by David Amo and Julio Navas called "La Sagrada Familia". It's a really simple track but it has that Fedde Le Grande "Put Your Hands Up" vibe about it. A future electro house classic perhaps?

If you enjoy the mix then [get in touch][4] and tell me what you think. Also, why not consider [donating some money][5] so that I can cover the costs of producing the podcasts and mixes. With the amount of downloads I have, it's not cheap! And finally, don't forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
