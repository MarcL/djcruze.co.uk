It&#8217;s been an awfully long time since I put a new mix onto my site so I managed to grab a couple of hours the other night and thought I&#8217;d do a new mix ready for my trip to Ibiza on Saturday. I&#8217;m off on a stag/bachelor weekend with some of the guys from Manchester and because the stag, Will, is a big fan of progressive house I thought I&#8217;d do a deep, dark and progressive mix for us to play while we&#8217;re out there. Obviously I thought you guys might like it too so here it is! I must warn you that it&#8217;s not my normal style and it gets a bit dark and twisted! It runs a fine line between electro, progressive and tech house but it&#8217;ll definitely get you in the mood for going out!

The mix kicks of with the king of electro house music, Mr. Eric Prydz and his homage to a Stockholm club called &#8220;F12&#8243; (&#8230;well, having just read an interview with him where he says it&#8217;s a favourite club of his, I&#8217;m assuming that&#8217;s why.) We&#8217;ve then got an exclusive tune from a soon-to-be-famous-I-hope Dutch producer [Duart Jansen][2] called &#8220;2 Cowboys&#8221; which is absolutely rocking. Then we head through a wicked Deamau5 remix of Mike Di Scala and on to a tough, jacking remix of Dave Spoon&#8217;s &#8220;88&#8243; by Mark Knight and Funkagenda.

Up next is another cheeky tune which is unfortunately doing the rounds on the internet but is too good not to play. I&#8217;m hoping Eric Prydz releases &#8220;Fabric Test&#8221; (which I assume was a test tune when he was playing at Fabric!) so that I can buy it but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be turning up on any of the legal download sites. It&#8217;s a wicked dark, electro track will sound huge in a club. I&#8217;ve then got a fantastic new electro house version of one of my favourite trance tracks, Three Drives &#8211; &#8220;Greece 2000&#8243;. Following that is an exclusive remix by the Funkfinders, otherwise known as DJ Cruze (yes, me!), on Alex Harmony&#8217;s &#8220;Nayati&#8221;. It&#8217;s a tougher remix than I&#8217;d normally do but I wanted to do something a bit different. It&#8217;s got chunky beats, a full on bassline and some massively crushed strings. Hope you like it! I&#8217;ll speak to Alex and hopefully I can put it on my website for you to download as it hasn&#8217;t been included in the final release. Let me know in the comments if you&#8217;d like to download it.

Moving on from my remix we&#8217;ve got a killer Deadmau5 sounding track from Dobenbeck and then onto Axwell&#8217;s Remode version of Adele&#8217;s &#8220;Hometown Glory&#8221;. I know I just played it on the [last podcast][3] but I love the pianos in it so I couldn&#8217;t help but put this version in the mix. Seemlessly mixing into that we&#8217;ve got &#8220;555&#8243; from the other members of the Swedish House Mafia, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso. This track almost has a techno feel to it but I think it&#8217;s just the right side of funky electro house for my taste. Finally we&#8217;ve got a massive breakdown with EDX&#8217;s &#8220;Premiumline&#8221; and onto the a jacking new tune by David Amo and Julio Navas called &#8220;La Sagrada Familia&#8221;. It&#8217;s a really simple track but it has that Fedde Le Grande &#8220;Put Your Hands Up&#8221; vibe about it. A future electro house classic perhaps?

If you enjoy the mix then [get in touch][4] and tell me what you think. Also, why not consider [donating some money][5] so that I can cover the costs of producing the podcasts and mixes. With the amount of downloads I have, it&#8217;s not cheap! And finally, don&#8217;t forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
