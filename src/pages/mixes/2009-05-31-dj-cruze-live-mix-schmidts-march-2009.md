I finally got round to uploading the live mix that a good friend of mine recorded at the [Vibration Revival party][2] I DJed at in Germany. Apologies that it took so long to upload. I didn&#8217;t do a full set on my own on that night so instead you&#8217;ve got 2 hours and 25 minutes of back-to-back old school house tunes from myself, Alex Harmony and Luke 45. I&#8217;d like to point out that I&#8217;m not responsible for some of the dodgy mixes (honestly!) and neither was I responsible for putting 2 Bad Mice&#8217;s &#8220;Bombscare&#8221; on twice. Luke 45 obviously wasn&#8217;t listening to me when I put it on! And who put on that awful &#8220;I&#8217;m Raving I&#8217;m Raving&#8221;? Was it Luke or Alex?! 

Enjoy and a big thanks to Pino for recording it. And Kai and Florian &#8211; you can both stop hassling me for it now!
