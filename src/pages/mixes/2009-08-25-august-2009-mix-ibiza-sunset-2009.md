It's been a while since I've done a new mix so I thought I'd make a sequel to last year's progressive and electro house mix [Ibiza Sunset][2]. Many of you commented and emailed to say that you enjoyed the mix a lot and everyone seemed to like the tougher tunes in the mix. I didn't manage to make it over to Ibiza this year but the mix is another hour of dark and pumping house tunes to get you in the mood for going out if you're heading out there.

This years Ibiza Sunset mix kicks off with a great track from Ronnie Foster called "Devil's Water". It has great cut-up vocals, crunchy percussion and a great breakdown which sets the scene nicely for the whole mix. Up next there's a big tune "Bon Bon" from John Dahlback and ATFC which is being hammered around the world at the moment. After that we have one of my favourite producers at the moment, Phonat, and his minimal house tune "Ho Visto Un Quadro Verde" (which means "I've seen a green picture" in Italian [apparently][3]). Phonat knows how to build a funky track even with minimal elements. Lazy Jay then supplies us with a big distorted breakdown on his track "Float My Boat" which has been a bit track for me for a while now.

We then head into tech-house territory for some heavy hitting tracks from some of house music's biggest producers. First up is "Isabel" from Swedish House Mafia member Steve Angello with its deep and dirty bassline and sweeping effects. After that we've got an electro-house piano anthem from France's Arno Cost with his new track "Cyan". Arno never fails to impress me with his orchestration and build-ups which always make for a pumping house track. Next up is an old but great remix from Swiss producer EDX on Funkagenda's "Breakwater". Although it came out a lot earlier this year I had to put this track in a mix as I absolutely love it. EDX knows how to build a track with great chord progressions and this remix is no exception. After that we have "Laktos" from another Swedish House Mafia member, Sebastian Ingrosso on his Refune label. It's deep and dirty but then a huge, emotional breakdown appears out of the mist only to drop back to dark, techy percussion. A monster of a track in the middle of the night!

Keeping with the Swedish House Mafia theme we have one of the biggest tracks of the year, in my opinion, "Melo" by Pryda (aka Eric Prydz). It's a hands-in-the-air progressive house track which makes me feel happy inside when I hear it. After this we have a lovely summer house track from the Swiss producer and label mate of EDX, DJ Tatana with her track "Autumn Sun". This track will make you think of the sun setting at Cafe Mambo if nothing else does. Next in the mix is a big track which is being hammered by Roger Sanchez called "Deaf Wax" by Mesa. It's a pumping electro house track with a big, distorted, bit-crushed breakdown. Finally, we've got a bootleg track from Joe T Vanelli who has turned the Coldplay track "Life In Technicolour" into a minimal house track with a huge breakdown. Actually, I think the Coldplay track is known as "The Escapist" as it was featured in a UK film of the same name which I watched the other night, but I presume he's named it like this as it's a hidden track on the "Life In Technicolour" track on their latest album. Either way, he's done great things to it!

So I hope you enjoyed the mix and if you did then [get in touch][4] and tell me.
