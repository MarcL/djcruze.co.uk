I didn't think 2024 would be the year that Cruze & Vuish would return to DJ in Germany! But after a party in January at GM Warehouse, we found ourselves invited back ti Weinheim for another night of house music. And what a party it was! ðŸŽ‰

Here's a 3.5 hour mix of some quality new and old houses from DJ Vuish and myself. We wanted to play a few new tracks but also give you some of the classic Manchester House music that you know and love.

I also made a couple of exclusive tracks for the mix which I'll share with you all soon.

The first is "Check It!" which started as an idea of me wanting an introduction track for when Cruze & Vuish came on stage. You probably realise that it's based around the "Super Sharp Shooter" track by DJ Zinc. It uses the LL Cool J track "It Gets No Rougher" for the alphabet drop and the bassline and guitar lick from his "Eat Em Up L Chill" track. I wanted a speed garage style track and I think the crowd enjoyed it.

The second track is "The Siren" which is based around the air-raid siren sample that I always used to drop at the start of my DJ sets in the 1990s and 2000s. It's a bit of a nod to the old school with a Korg M1 bass and some pianos and breakbeats. I probably need to rework it a bit but it sounded good in the club and the hands were definitely in the air!

DJ Vuish played loads of amazing tracks and took it a bit tougher at times and the crowd loved it. We always enjoy DJing together and had a great time playing back-to-back at the end.

I added the tracklist which I think is correct but shout if you think I've missed anything.

Please enjoy the mix and get it downloaded to your phone or laptop if you want to! ðŸ™Œ
