## The DJ Cruze Podcast

The DJ Cruze podcast started way back in 2005.

It was a way for me to share some new music with my fans and friends and slowly gained a cult following.

It was a monthly radio-style show and was pretty regular up until we had children in the late 2000s. It then became a bit more sporadic!

Here's an archive of all of the shows from 2005 to 2011. I'e not recorded a new one since 2011 but never say never!
