You may remember a while ago that I talked about some ideas I had for the website to keep things fresh. Well finally I've managed to get things up and running in my studio and you'll find something quite exciting happening...

**_What is it then?_**

Introducing the **DJ Cruze Podcast**!!

In case you have no idea what I'm talking about then here is a quote from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast):

> _Podcasting is a method of publishing audio programs via the Internet, allowing users to subscribe to a feed of new files (usually MP3s)._

I've done a radio show but in a compact MP3 format. It's about 50 minutes long so that's about 35MB in total (at 96KBps). If you have a broadband internet connection then it shouldn't be too bad to download. Download it, stick it on your iPod, portable MP3 player or computer and you'll have me, [DJ Cruze]({{site.url}}), playing some of my new tunes and talking rubbish!

You can download the show using the link above if you want. Just simply right click on the link above and save it to your computer. But a better way to do it is to to subscribe to the podcast RSS feed.

The show was done last weekend so sorry it's a bit late getting onto the website. I had to do some things to get it running properly. The tags might not show up properly in iTunes yet but that's something I'll tweak over the next couple of weeks. It's better getting the show onto the website than not!

**So what's in the show?**  
As I said, it's about 50 minutes at the moment and it comprises of my latest chart, some chat and a classic tune. I'm hoping to do the show every two weeks and I'll vary the format until I get it right. You guys and girls have to tell me what you want from it so get involved and [contact me](/contact).

I hope you like it as I really enjoyed doing it. You'll no longer be able to complain that I don't do any mixes as you'll get one delivered hot and fresh to your computer every two weeks (and maybe more often if you all subscribe and tell me you enjoy it). Let me know if you like it and what you would like to hear on the show!
