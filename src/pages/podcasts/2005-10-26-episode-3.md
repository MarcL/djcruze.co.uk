Oh yes! Another DJ Cruze podcast is online. Manchester has brought Episode #3 into the house:

Your magic podcatcher (iTunes or otherwise) should be downloading it as you sleep, work or whatever else you're up to. If not then the direct link to download is above. Right click on it, save the MP3 file to your hard drive and stick it on your MP3 player or just play it on your computer.

Here is the tracklisting for this week's show:

Oh and I promised I'd put a link to [Gary Reynold's website][11]. He's either one of the Starlet DJs or he's just remixed them. He has a very...erm... "interesting" website. I'd get a graphic designer involved if I were you Gaz! ðŸ˜ƒ

So are you guys and girls enjoying the show? Let me know what you're thinking using the [contact form][12]. I'm looking for some more unsigned tracks to showcase on the podcast too so get in touch and I'll play your tune.
