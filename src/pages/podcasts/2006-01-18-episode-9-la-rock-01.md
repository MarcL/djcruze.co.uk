Happy new year and welcome to the first podcast for 2006. Podcast episode #9 features a special guest mix from my good friend and fellow DJ, Matthew Brooks. Matt is a DJ and promoter of the excellent [Accident and Emergency][1] collective. It&#8217;s something a bit different for the podcast as it flows from dirty electro house and filthy acid madness, right up to some drum and bass but as always it&#8217;s damn funky! Download it here:
