Happy new year and welcome to the first podcast for 2006. Podcast episode #9 features a special guest mix from my good friend and fellow DJ, Matthew Brooks. Matt is a DJ and promoter of the excellent Accident and Emergency collective. It's something a bit different for the podcast as it flows from dirty electro house and filthy acid madness, right up to some drum and bass but as always it's damn funky! Download it above
