In the words of Disco Four (from their track "Get Busy"):

> The scratch. The bass. The congas in your face. The King of the beats gonna rock the place!

As I mentioned in the show I've been downloading some more podcasts for my iPod and here are two you should definitely check out if you like house music:

- [Alex Harmony][12] – Der Harmonizer ist im Haus! Alex is rocking a funky tech-electro sound with a classic thrown in for good measure. Even if you don't speak German it's worth a download. He said he might do the next in English anyway so keep subscribed.
- [One Phat DJ][13] – He's phat not fat! Funky tunes with a similar taste in music to me. A must have on your iPod.

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][14] using the form provided and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I'm always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you're an up and coming producer who's looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes then I'll play them.
