In the words of Disco Four (from their track &#8220;Get Busy&#8221;):

> The scratch. The bass. The congas in your face. The King of the beats gonna rock the place!

The King of the Beats is here with podcast episode #10. Make your ears happy and download it here:

As always, here is the tracklisting for the show:

  * **DJ Cruze chart rundown:** 
      * [Olav Basoski][3] &#8211; Wait and See &#8211; [Rootz Records][4]
      * Filterfunk &#8211; S.O.S. (Message In A Bottle) (Delano &#038; Crockett Remix) &#8211; [Gusto][5]
      * Axer &#8211; 123 &#8211; [Pryda Records][6]
      * The Modern &#8211; Industry (Bimbo Jones Dub) &#8211; Mercury
      * Solu Music feat. Kimberlee &#8211; Fade (Grant Nelson Big Room Vocal Mix) &#8211; [Hed Kandi][7]
      * [Shapeshifters][8] &#8211; Incredible (Denis The Menace &#038; Jerry Roperoâ€™s Full Vocal Mix) &#8211; [Positiva][9]
      * [Joey Negro][10] &#8211; Make A Move On Me &#8211; [Z Records][11]
  * **Cruze classic from 1991:** 
      * The House Crew &#8211; Keep The Fire Burning &#8211; Production House

As I mentioned in the show I&#8217;ve been downloading some more podcasts for my iPod and here are two you should definitely check out if you like house music:

  * [Alex Harmony][12] &#8211; Der Harmonizer ist im Haus! Alex is rocking a funky tech-electro sound with a classic thrown in for good measure. Even if you don&#8217;t speak German it&#8217;s worth a download. He said he might do the next in English anyway so keep subscribed.
  * [One Phat DJ][13] &#8211; He&#8217;s phat not fat! Funky tunes with a similar taste in music to me. A must have on your iPod.

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][14] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes then I&#8217;ll play them.
