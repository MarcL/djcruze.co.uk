Sorry that I didn&#8217;t manage to get this episode done last week. I meant to sort it out but it just didn&#8217;t happen. Hopefully that means you&#8217;re ready for another installment of the DJ Cruze podcast now though. Episode #12 brings you the old, the new and the down right funky!


Don&#8217;t forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don&#8217;t like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it&#8217;s terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

I mentioned a couple of new podcasts that I have downloaded so here are the links to them. Just cut and paste the link and put it into iTunes or the podcatching software that you use.

  * [Timmy Boy][23] – You&#8217;ll have to click on the link on Tim&#8217;s site to download it. A nice mix using [Garage Band][24].
  * [DJ Flin podcast][25] – Some nice mixing and tunes from Sascha here. But stop copying the text on my website please! 

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][26] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes then I&#8217;ll play them.
