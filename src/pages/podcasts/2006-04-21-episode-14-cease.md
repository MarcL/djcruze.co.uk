It&#8217;s been far too long hasn&#8217;t it? After darkness comes light, and sad times bring happy memories and brighter days. Hopefully I can spread some sunshine into your life with the latest DJ Cruze funky house music podcast.

This podcast is dedicated to my grandad. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d have hated house music, if he knew what it was. He was much happier listening to an Irish classic by The Dubliners but I&#8217;m sure he would have appreciated the sentiment. I hope he&#8217;s having an Irish whiskey up there!

Thanks to everyone who sent me messages of support of the past few weeks. It&#8217;s been a tough time but these things will always happen and there&#8217;s never a good time for death. It&#8217;s time to carry on and remember the happy times.

Don&#8217;t forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don&#8217;t like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it&#8217;s terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][15] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I&#8217;ll play them.
