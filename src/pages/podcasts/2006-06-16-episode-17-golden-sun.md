Yes, it&#8217;s been far too long since episode #16 of the DJ Cruze podcast. Sorry about that. Sometimes work and partying get in the way of supplying you with upfront, funky house music. But it&#8217;s finished&#8230;finally. Episode #17 of the DJ Cruze podcast is here for your listening pleasure.

A lot of people have asked me where they can get the Nelly Furtado remix that I played on [episode #16][3] of the show. I&#8217;ve finally finished the mix and [you will find it here][4]. Download, burn it to a CD or stick it on your MP3 player and play it loud!

Don&#8217;t forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don&#8217;t like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it&#8217;s terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][5] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I&#8217;ll play them.
