Yes, it's been far too long since episode #16 of the DJ Cruze podcast. Sorry about that. Sometimes work and partying get in the way of supplying you with upfront, funky house music. But it's finished&#8230;finally. Episode #17 of the DJ Cruze podcast is here for your listening pleasure.

A lot of people have asked me where they can get the Nelly Furtado remix that I played on [episode #16][3] of the show. I've finally finished the mix and [you will find it here][4]. Download, burn it to a CD or stick it on your MP3 player and play it loud!

Don't forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don't like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it's terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][5] using the form provided and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I'm always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you're an up and coming producer who's looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I'll play them.
