It&#8217;s been far too long since the last show again, sorry about that. As most of you know, I&#8217;m getting married in a few weeks time (actually nearer to two weeks now) so life is pretty hectic. This show will be the last for a month now so I hope you enjoy it. It&#8217;s full of summery vibes and I&#8217;m loving the tunes. Enjoy!

Don&#8217;t forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don&#8217;t like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it&#8217;s terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][16] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I&#8217;ll play them.
