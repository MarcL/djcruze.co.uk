After a brief hiatus the DJ Cruze podcast returns with episode #21. I&#8217;m back with some dirty electro and funky house tunes to rock your MP3 player so get it downloaded as soon as you can. This week&#8217;s show doesn&#8217;t have a classic but instead I&#8217;m dedicating a tune to my lovely wife Clare! Aaah!

Don&#8217;t forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don&#8217;t like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it&#8217;s terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][1] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I&#8217;ll play them.
