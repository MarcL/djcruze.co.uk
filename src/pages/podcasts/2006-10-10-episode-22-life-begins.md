Back again? And within two weeks (&#8230;well, almost two weeks!)? That can&#8217;t be happening can it? Amazingly, episode #22 of the DJ Cruze podcast is live and it&#8217;s a corker! A little mellower than the last episode, it&#8217;s back to the funky style that you know and love.

There are some great tunes on this episode. Check out the reggae stylings of Lucky 7&#8242;s &#8220;Why?&#8221;. It&#8217;s by an unknown producer, well I&#8217;ve not been told who it is anyway. Could it be Olav Basoski in another guise? There&#8217;s a great new remix of &#8220;Believe&#8221; by Ministers De La Funk on the massive Italian label Oxyd. Big thanks to Davide for sending it to me.
