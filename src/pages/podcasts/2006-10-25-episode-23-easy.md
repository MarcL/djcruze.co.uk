Finally episode #23 of the DJ Cruze podcast arrives at your door like an old friend. Sorry that it took a bit longer than it should have done. I sorted the mix out a few days ago and wanted to master it (so that it sounds nice for you all) like I always do. And then yet again my old PC crashed. So I&#8217;ve spent the last few hours trying to save the podcast and thankfully I&#8217;ve sorted it out. Fingers crossed that it will last a bit longer until I&#8217;ve copied all of my data over to my external hard drive.

Anyway, there are plenty more funky tunes on this week&#8217;s podcast. You&#8217;ll find some funky remixes by some superstars such as Justin Timberlake and Madonna. Yes, I know they&#8217;re commercial but when you&#8217;ve got the likes of Axwell remixing them does it really matter? They&#8217;ve got amazing vocalists and that&#8217;s what counts. I&#8217;ve also got an old favourite from Tall Paul which has had a fresh 2006 remix from the Rhythm Masters and also a great remix of the Sugarbabes by the ever consistent Seamus Haji. What more could you ask for? Album art you say? Well hopefully this show has album art. I won&#8217;t know whether it has worked until it&#8217;s on my iPod but fingers crossed. If it doesn&#8217;t then I&#8217;ll have to find another way. Do people really want AAC files rather than MP3s so that they&#8217;re iPod friendly? I don&#8217;t think so but maybe you guys want that. Let me know in the comments section.

**Update:** _Yes, the image worked in iTunes and on my iPod! I need to play about with it a bit to get the correct size but at least the test worked. Please let me know if it works in other podcatchers._

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][1] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I&#8217;ll play them.
