Finally episode #23 of the DJ Cruze podcast arrives at your door like an old friend. Sorry that it took a bit longer than it should have done. I sorted the mix out a few days ago and wanted to master it (so that it sounds nice for you all) like I always do. And then yet again my old PC crashed. So I've spent the last few hours trying to save the podcast and thankfully I've sorted it out. Fingers crossed that it will last a bit longer until I've copied all of my data over to my external hard drive.

Anyway, there are plenty more funky tunes on this week's podcast. You'll find some funky remixes by some superstars such as Justin Timberlake and Madonna. Yes, I know they're commercial but when you've got the likes of Axwell remixing them does it really matter? They've got amazing vocalists and that's what counts. I've also got an old favourite from Tall Paul which has had a fresh 2006 remix from the Rhythm Masters and also a great remix of the Sugarbabes by the ever consistent Seamus Haji. What more could you ask for? Album art you say? Well hopefully this show has album art. I won't know whether it has worked until it's on my iPod but fingers crossed. If it doesn't then I'll have to find another way. Do people really want AAC files rather than MP3s so that they're iPod friendly? I don't think so but maybe you guys want that. Let me know in the comments section.

**Update:** _Yes, the image worked in iTunes and on my iPod! I need to play about with it a bit to get the correct size but at least the test worked. Please let me know if it works in other podcatchers._

Don't forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don't like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it's terrible then give it a 1. Go on... you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][1] using the form provided and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I'm always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you're an up and coming producer who's looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I'll play them.
