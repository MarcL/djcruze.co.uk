Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! It's that time of year again when I bring some funky house tunes and dirty electro and leave it under the Christmas tree. Episode #25 of the DJ Cruze podcast will be appearing in your podcatcher on Christmas morning. It's a lot better than that lump of coal you received last year for being a naughty boy or girl!

As promised, it features the cheeky DJ Cruze Funkfinders remix of the Eartha Kitt classic "Santa Baby". I've only used a little bit of the vocal but I hope I've turned it into a funky house tune that you'll enjoy. Check out the other funky tracks from the likes of Stonebridge, Olav Basoski, the Soul Avengerz and Raul Rincon. It's like a who's who of the most famous house producers at the moment! Enjoy!

Don't forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don't like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it's terrible then give it a 1. Go on... you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][1] using the form provided and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I'm always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you're an up and coming producer who's looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I'll play them.

Oh and don't forget to check out the website over Christmas for the [six mini-mixes of Christmas][2]! Yet more great mixes for you to download. Merry Christmas!
