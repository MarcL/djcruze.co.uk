Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! It&#8217;s that time of year again when I bring some funky house tunes and dirty electro and leave it under the Christmas tree. Episode #25 of the DJ Cruze podcast will be appearing in your podcatcher on Christmas morning. It&#8217;s a lot better than that lump of coal you received last year for being a naughty boy or girl!

As promised, it features the cheeky DJ Cruze Funkfinders remix of the Eartha Kitt classic &#8220;Santa Baby&#8221;. I&#8217;ve only used a little bit of the vocal but I hope I&#8217;ve turned it into a funky house tune that you&#8217;ll enjoy. Check out the other funky tracks from the likes of Stonebridge, Olav Basoski, the Soul Avengerz and Raul Rincon. It&#8217;s like a who&#8217;s who of the most famous house producers at the moment! Enjoy!
