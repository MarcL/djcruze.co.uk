Christmas is over and it's time to get back to work so what better way to start off the year than a new DJ Cruze podcast. Episode #27 brings you lots of funky tunes and plenty of dirty electro as always. The big tunes for me on this show are the new track by [Kid Massive][1], the new [Camille Jones][2] track and the latest [Basoski][3] and [Romano][4] EP. So get subscribed, get downloading and enjoy the tunes on your iPod or MP3 player.

Don't forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don't like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it's terrible then give it a 1. Go on... you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][5] using the form provided and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I'm always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you're an up and coming producer who's looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I'll play them.
