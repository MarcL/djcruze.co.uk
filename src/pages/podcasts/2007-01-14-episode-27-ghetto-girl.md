Christmas is over and it&#8217;s time to get back to work so what better way to start off the year than a new DJ Cruze podcast. Episode #27 brings you lots of funky tunes and plenty of dirty electro as always. The big tunes for me on this show are the new track by [Kid Massive][1], the new [Camille Jones][2] track and the latest [Basoski][3] and [Romano][4] EP. So get subscribed, get downloading and enjoy the tunes on your iPod or MP3 player.

Don&#8217;t forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don&#8217;t like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it&#8217;s terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][5] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I&#8217;ll play them.
