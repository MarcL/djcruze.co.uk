excerpt: "Podcast #28 is here and it is time to chill out a little bit after the Christmas holidays. I've been sent loads of great soulful tunes over the past few weeks and thought I'd share a few of them with you at the start of the show. Most of the time I'm playing a bit tougher or funkier in the clubs but it's nice to play some warm-up tunes to start off the show."

Podcast #28 is here and it is time to chill out a little bit after the Christmas holidays. I&#8217;ve been sent loads of great soulful tunes over the past few weeks and thought I&#8217;d share a few of them with you at the start of the show. Most of the time I&#8217;m playing a bit tougher or funkier in the clubs but it&#8217;s nice to play some warm-up tunes to start off the show.

Another thing that you guys and girls might have noticed is an improvement in sound quality. I&#8217;ve decided to see how my bandwidth holds out when I give you 128 kbps MP3s instead of the 96 kbps MP3s that I used to give. It does give a lot better sound quality but I&#8217;m wary of it costing me too much in bandwidth costs and also the fact that in theory people could make an edit of one of the tracks. Hopefully I do enough talking for that to not be a problem! Go out and buy the tracks if you like them!

Don&#8217;t forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don&#8217;t like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it&#8217;s terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][1] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I&#8217;ll play them.
