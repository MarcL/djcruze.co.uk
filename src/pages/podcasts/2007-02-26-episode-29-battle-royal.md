  And finally the podcast appeared! Amazing!
  
  Here is episode #29 of the DJ Cruze podcast and it has been a long time coming, I know, I know! I've been whizzing down the mountain in sunny (and snowy) Sainte Foy in the French Alps. I then came home and took my lovely wife Clare off to Prague for a few days of sight seeing, beer drinking (...that was mainly me!) and good, cheap food eating fun! So now that I'm back I've had to catch up and find some time to get the DJ Cruze podcast sorted. So here it is...

And finally the podcast appeared! Amazing!

Here is episode #29 of the DJ Cruze podcast and it has been a long time coming, I know, I know! I've been whizzing down the mountain in sunny (and snowy) Sainte Foy in the French Alps. I then came home and took my lovely wife Clare off to Prague for a few days of sight seeing, beer drinking (&#8230;that was mainly me!) and good, cheap food eating fun! So now that I'm back I've had to catch up and find some time to get the DJ Cruze podcast sorted. So here it is.

There are loads of great tunes on this episdode. The new D Ramirez remix of the old Brand New Heavies vocalist N'Dea Davenport kicks off the show and it rocks! A nice chunky bassline leads us into the funky sounds of up and coming producer Jay Cox followed by a cheeky bootleg from a great Italian producer, Alex Gaudino. Then there's my big tune of the moment from Does It Offend You, Yeah? who are the biggest thing to hit dirty house music since Daft Punk. I'm looking forward to hearing their album when it comes out after hearing Battle Royale! When then head through loads more funky house and dirty electro until we hit one of my favourite old tunes – the Perfecto mix of &#8220;Mr Wendall&#8221; by Arrested Development. Talk about a massive tune! I hope all of these hot tunes make up for the lack of a podcast over the past month.

Don't forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don't like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it's terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][1] using the form provided and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I'm always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you're an up and coming producer who's looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I'll play them.
