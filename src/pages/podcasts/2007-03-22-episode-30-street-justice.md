After all of the stress with getting the last episode online I&#8217;m now back with episode #30 of the DJ Cruze podcast. As I said in an earlier post, most of my studio has been dismantled but I managed to put a bit of it back together to do the mix. However, I&#8217;m without a microphone at the moment so you&#8217;ll just have to put up with the tunes and no shoutouts! I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll cope and I know some of you prefer it that way! Enjoy the mix and I&#8217;ll be back with a full studio setup soon.

Don&#8217;t forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don&#8217;t like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it&#8217;s terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][1] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I&#8217;ll play them.
