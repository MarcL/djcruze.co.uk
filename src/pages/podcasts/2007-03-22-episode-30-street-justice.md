After all of the stress with getting the last episode online I'm now back with episode #30 of the DJ Cruze podcast. As I said in an earlier post, most of my studio has been dismantled but I managed to put a bit of it back together to do the mix. However, I'm without a microphone at the moment so you'll just have to put up with the tunes and no shoutouts! I'm sure you'll cope and I know some of you prefer it that way! Enjoy the mix and I'll be back with a full studio setup soon.

Don't forget to rate this podcast so I know what you like and don't like. Run your mouse over the stars underneath the title of this podcast and it allows you to rate it. If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it's terrible then give it a 1. Go on... you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][1] using the form provided and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I'm always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you're an up and coming producer who's looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I'll play them.
