Well this one took a long time didn&#8217;t it? Two months to get the podcast online is far too long I know but life has been a bit crazy at the moment. Our baby is due in just 6 days time so I&#8217;ve been busy preparing our house ready for our new arrival and we can&#8217;t wait to see if we&#8217;re having a boy or a girl. I&#8217;ll introduce you all to the mini-Cruze once he or she appears!

So it&#8217;s better late than never as they say. I&#8217;ve got another hour (&#8230;well, almost) of funky house music and electro house for your listening pleasure. Of course no podcast would be complete without the obligatory Cruze Classic and this one is massive. Liquid&#8217;s &#8220;Sweet Harmony&#8221; has always had a place in my heart and I can&#8217;t believe it has taken 31 episodes and nearly two years of the podcast to get it in the show. Enjoy the tunes and live in sweet harmony!

If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it&#8217;s terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!

As always I love to hear your feed back on the show. [Contact me][1] using the form provided and I&#8217;ll get back to you as soon as I can. I&#8217;m always looking for new tunes to play on the show so if you&#8217;re an up and coming producer who&#8217;s looking for some exposure then let me know and if I like the tunes, I&#8217;ll play them.
