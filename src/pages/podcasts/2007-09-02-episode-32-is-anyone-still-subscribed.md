Evening all. I&#8217;ve managed to find another couple of hours to get an official podcast done rather than just a mix which I put out a couple of weeks ago. It&#8217;s got plenty of new funky tunes on there and an absolutely classic Cruze classic! If you&#8217;ve never heard the Graeme Park mix of The Brand New Heavies track &#8220;Back To Love&#8221; played **LOUD** in a club then you&#8217;ve never lived. It&#8217;s a quality feel good house tune with a stonking piano remix by the ex-Hacienda DJ Graeme Park. An absolutely amazing tune!

Also on the podcast are some other great funky tracks remixed by men of the moment, [Wawa][3], and the new kid on the dirty house block, [Deadmau5][4]. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have more time to do a podcast each month again as well as a monthly mix. That&#8217;s the plan anyway! Enjoy the tunes.

If you like it then give me a big phat 10. If it&#8217;s terrible then give it a 1. Go on&#8230; you know you want to vote!
