The long winter nights are drawing in here in the UK so what better to warm you up than another DJ Cruze podcast. It's another hour of the funkiest and most twisted house music and electro house that you'll find on the internet. We've got some choice remixes and tracks from the hot Dutch producer-du-jour, Peter Gelderblom, a cheeky remake of the Bob Marley vs Funkstar Delux track &#8220;Sun Is Shining&#8221; which came originally came out in 1999 and also The Pet Shop Boys! Admittedly it's the Dave Spoon dub version of The Pet Shop Boys and not the original. Where do you think we're going? Back to the 80s?!

My personal favourite on the show today is the killer Stonebridge remix of Sia's new tune &#8220;The Girl You Lost To Cocaine&#8221;. A quality production as always from one of my favourite producers and remixers. A thumping bassline and some dirty drums make it a dancefloor destroyer! As requested by a few people, I've also added a running order to the tracklisting so you can see the times at which each track kicks in. Hopefully it'll make it easy for you guys to work out which tracks you want to download. Enjoy the podcast!
