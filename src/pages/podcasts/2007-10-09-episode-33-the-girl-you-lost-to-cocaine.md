The long winter nights are drawing in here in the UK so what better to warm you up than another DJ Cruze podcast. It&#8217;s another hour of the funkiest and most twisted house music and electro house that you&#8217;ll find on the internet. We&#8217;ve got some choice remixes and tracks from the hot Dutch producer-du-jour, Peter Gelderblom, a cheeky remake of the Bob Marley vs Funkstar Delux track &#8220;Sun Is Shining&#8221; which came originally came out in 1999 and also The Pet Shop Boys! Admittedly it&#8217;s the Dave Spoon dub version of The Pet Shop Boys and not the original. Where do you think we&#8217;re going? Back to the 80s?!

My personal favourite on the show today is the killer Stonebridge remix of Sia&#8217;s new tune &#8220;The Girl You Lost To Cocaine&#8221;. A quality production as always from one of my favourite producers and remixers. A thumping bassline and some dirty drums make it a dancefloor destroyer! As requested by a few people, I&#8217;ve also added a running order to the tracklisting so you can see the times at which each track kicks in. Hopefully it&#8217;ll make it easy for you guys to work out which tracks you want to download. Enjoy the podcast!
