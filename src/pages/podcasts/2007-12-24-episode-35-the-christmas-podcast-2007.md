So here I am on Christmas Eve and I&#8217;m full of a cold. Isn&#8217;t it always the way? And the best way to get rid of a cold? Obviously it&#8217;s a new DJ Cruze podcast!

Here is episode #35 of the DJ Cruze podcast and because of my sneezing and sniffing I&#8217;m not doing the shoutouts and track names that I normally do. You don&#8217;t really need an hour of a sniffly DJ do you? Instead I&#8217;ve given you 60 minutes of funky house tunes and dirty electro without my usual interruptions. As always with the the Christmas Podcast, I am kicking it off with a bootleg. This year I&#8217;ve decided to do a funky house version of Lou Rawls &#8220;Have Yourself A Very Merry Christmas&#8221;. It&#8217;s funky. It&#8217;s chunky. So enjoy it!

Get the podcast downloaded here:

Don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;ll be doing the &#8220;Best of 2007&#8243; podcast before the end of the year and with all of the great tunes that we&#8217;ve had in 2007 it&#8217;ll be a corker! So a big &#8220;MERRY CHRISTMAS&#8221; from DJ Cruze and here&#8217;s to another year of the funkiest house tunes.
