It's that time of year again when I give you the "Best of ..." podcast. Apologies that it didn't come before 31st December 2007 as promised but [I was in bed full of the winter vomiting virus][1] which wasn't fun at all. So here are the bad boys, the heavy hitters, the killer tunes that rocked my dancefloors in 2007 all mixed up into a hot 74 minute mix.

**[00:00:00] N'Dea Davenport – One Day My Love (D'Ramirez 12" Mix) – Dozer Records**  
This tune came out in the early part of 2007 and was a huge tune for me even though it didn't get much commercial success in the charts. It has a great vocal from the [Brand New Heavies][4] ex-vocalist, [N'Dea Davenport][5] and features a dirty bassline from one of my favourite electro producers in 2007, [D'Ramirez][6].

**[00:05:45] Camille Jones – The Creeps (Fedde Le Grande Club Mix) – Data Records**  
Originally coming out in 2006, the [Fedde Le Grand][7] electro house mix of this electronic track by Danish beauty [Camille Jones][8] just pushed it into 2007. Featuring a fantastic vocal and a wicked remix by man of 2007, Fedde Le Grand, it's got to be in everyone's best of chart for last year. The vocal on this track is haunting and I love it.

**[00:11:52] Andrea Doria vs LXR – Freak Me (Dave Spoon Remix) – GI Recordings**  
Another big producer from 2007 was [Dave Spoon][9]. He captured the electro house scene by storm and produced some of last year's best dirty house remixes. This remix of "Freak Me" by the Italian producer [Andrea Doria][10] is no exception. Initially sounding like Sly and Robbie's "Boops" from the late 80s (yes, I'm that old and I remember it well!) it then steps up a notch and gives us some fantastic distorted synths and a disturbingly dirty breakdown. A peak time stormer!

**[00:17:48] Dragonette – I Get Around (Van She Dub Mix) – Mercury**  
Although signed to a major label, the Canadian band [Dragonette][11] seemed to be big on the underground scene but didn't get as much exposure in the mainstream press. Here we get a lovely electro dub of their track "I Get Around" from Australian band [Van She][12] and it just rocks. A repeated "I Get Around" vocal drives this track and the pumping, compressed bassline shook the dancefloors I played this on. Let's hope both Van She and Dragonette get some more tunes out in 2008.

**[00:22:56] Larry Tee – Licky (Herve Goes Low Remix) – White**  
[Larry Tee][13] apparently invented the term electroclash. Did you know that? Neither did I. He's an old school producer who produced a lot of the big "electroclash" acts from the mid 2000s. This [Herve][14] remix takes us back to the old rave days with it's sirens, deep and pumping bassline and chunky rave stabs. A definite club tune which might not sound so good on your ipod unless you've got better bass response headphones. Even then it might just hurt your ears, but in a good way!

**[00:27:41] DJ DLG – Your Eyes (Original Mix) – Eyezcream Recordings**  
It's been a good year for Canadian producer [DJ DLG][15] with his big 80s sampling tune "Your Eyes". A solid but repetitive track that builds up and up until it drops a killer breakdown.

**[00:32:41] Mighty Dub Katz – Magic Carpet Ride (Young Punx Remix) – Southern Fried Records**  
A cheeky [Norman Cook][16] re-released his classic "Magic Carpet Ride" under his Mighty Dub Katz moniker. This time we get a deep and dubby remix from [The Young Punx][17]. Although it's been out a few times since the mid 90s, this mix worked well for me and everyone loves its cheeky ballroom, breakdown!

**[00:38:03] Axwell – I Found You (Remode) – Axtone**  
The biggest tune of 2007? Yes, quite probably. [Axwell][18] takes us back to an early 90s breakbeat rave track with this anthem. Featuring a Faithless style arpeggio, some phat and funky breakbeats, some old school pianos and a great vocal from Charles Salter it was the monster tune of last summer. Rave on!

**[00:43:48] Armand Van Helden – NYC Beat (Original Mix) – Southern Fried Records**  
The year wouldn't be complete without a killer track from [Armand Van Helden][19]! A dirty bassline? Check! A punk-funk 80s vocal? Check! Some dirty beats with some wicked percussion? Check! A massive tune? You bet!

**[00:49:03] Sia – The Girl You Lost To Cocaine (Stonebridge Club Mix) – Monkey Puzzle Records**  
The Swedish house music producer [Stonebridge][20] takes the surly [Sia][21] away from his usual piano-tinged remixes and gives us a filthy basslined monster. Amazing haunting vocals are layered on top of this tough house track and it became one of my favourite tunes of the year.

**[00:55:48] Coburn – Razorblade (Malente Remix) – Great Stuff**  
More tough stuff comes from those cheeky boys from the UK, [Coburn][22], who gave us 2005's killer track "We Interrupt This Program". "Like Kylie on acid" is how they describe the track and who am I to argue? Given a cheeky rerub by German producer [Malente][23] it builds up with a big old bassline and some bit crunched breakdowns. Club music for the world's dirty dancefloor!

**[00:62:18] Bodyrox ft. Luciana – What Planet You On (The Slacksons Mix) – Phonetic Records**  
After the massive success of their track "Yeah Yeah" last year, [Bodyrox][24] are back with another huge electro house cut. [The Slacksons][25] turn this into a potential house music classic with it's building bassline and twisting percussion. This is how all house music should be!

**[00:00:00] Axwell & Sebastian Ingrosso vs. Salem Al Fakir – It's True (Original Mix) – Axtone**  
And finally a somewhat under-exposed [Axtone][26] track which may get more play in the Ibiza in the summer of 2008. In my opinion it has the potential to be the new Stardust or Modjo. It's a fun and funky summer tune which showcases Salem's smooth vocals and Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso's funkier house roots. You can't help but smile when you hear the the electric guitar followed by the brilliantly simple "it's true, life will smile for you" chorus. A great way to finish off my "best of 2007 mix". Life will definitely smile for all of us in 2008.

So I hope you enjoyed this years, or should that be last years, "best of ..." mix. I think they are all awesome and I hope you do too! Big love to you all for the support you give me and for all of the comments on the site. I hope 2008 brings more listeners and more funky house music!
