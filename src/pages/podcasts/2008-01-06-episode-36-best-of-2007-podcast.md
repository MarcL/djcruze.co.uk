It&#8217;s that time of year again when I give you the &#8220;Best of &#8230;&#8221; podcast. Apologies that it didn&#8217;t come before 31st December 2007 as promised but [I was in bed full of the winter vomiting virus][1] which wasn&#8217;t fun at all. So here are the bad boys, the heavy hitters, the killer tunes that rocked my dancefloors in 2007 all mixed up into a hot 74 minute mix.

**[00:00:00] N&#8217;Dea Davenport &#8211; One Day My Love (D&#8217;Ramirez 12&#8243; Mix) &#8211; Dozer Records**  
This tune came out in the early part of 2007 and was a huge tune for me even though it didn&#8217;t get much commercial success in the charts. It has a great vocal from the [Brand New Heavies][4] ex-vocalist, [N&#8217;Dea Davenport][5] and features a dirty bassline from one of my favourite electro producers in 2007, [D&#8217;Ramirez][6].

**[00:05:45] Camille Jones &#8211; The Creeps (Fedde Le Grande Club Mix) &#8211; Data Records**  
Originally coming out in 2006, the [Fedde Le Grand][7] electro house mix of this electronic track by Danish beauty [Camille Jones][8] just pushed it into 2007. Featuring a fantastic vocal and a wicked remix by man of 2007, Fedde Le Grand, it&#8217;s got to be in everyone&#8217;s best of chart for last year. The vocal on this track is haunting and I love it.

**[00:11:52] Andrea Doria vs LXR &#8211; Freak Me (Dave Spoon Remix) &#8211; GI Recordings**  
Another big producer from 2007 was [Dave Spoon][9]. He captured the electro house scene by storm and produced some of last year&#8217;s best dirty house remixes. This remix of &#8220;Freak Me&#8221; by the Italian producer [Andrea Doria][10] is no exception. Initially sounding like Sly and Robbie&#8217;s &#8220;Boops&#8221; from the late 80s (yes, I&#8217;m that old and I remember it well!) it then steps up a notch and gives us some fantastic distorted synths and a disturbingly dirty breakdown. A peak time stormer!

**[00:17:48] Dragonette &#8211; I Get Around (Van She Dub Mix) &#8211; Mercury**  
Although signed to a major label, the Canadian band [Dragonette][11] seemed to be big on the underground scene but didn&#8217;t get as much exposure in the mainstream press. Here we get a lovely electro dub of their track &#8220;I Get Around&#8221; from Australian band [Van She][12] and it just rocks. A repeated &#8220;I Get Around&#8221; vocal drives this track and the pumping, compressed bassline shook the dancefloors I played this on. Let&#8217;s hope both Van She and Dragonette get some more tunes out in 2008.

**[00:22:56] Larry Tee &#8211; Licky (Herve Goes Low Remix) &#8211; White**  
[Larry Tee][13] apparently invented the term electroclash. Did you know that? Neither did I. He&#8217;s an old school producer who produced a lot of the big &#8220;electroclash&#8221; acts from the mid 2000s. This [Herve][14] remix takes us back to the old rave days with it&#8217;s sirens, deep and pumping bassline and chunky rave stabs. A definite club tune which might not sound so good on your ipod unless you&#8217;ve got better bass response headphones. Even then it might just hurt your ears, but in a good way!

**[00:27:41] DJ DLG &#8211; Your Eyes (Original Mix) &#8211; Eyezcream Recordings**  
It&#8217;s been a good year for Canadian producer [DJ DLG][15] with his big 80s sampling tune &#8220;Your Eyes&#8221;. A solid but repetitive track that builds up and up until it drops a killer breakdown.

**[00:32:41] Mighty Dub Katz &#8211; Magic Carpet Ride (Young Punx Remix) &#8211; Southern Fried Records**  
A cheeky [Norman Cook][16] re-released his classic &#8220;Magic Carpet Ride&#8221; under his Mighty Dub Katz moniker. This time we get a deep and dubby remix from [The Young Punx][17]. Although it&#8217;s been out a few times since the mid 90s, this mix worked well for me and everyone loves its cheeky ballroom, breakdown!

**[00:38:03] Axwell &#8211; I Found You (Remode) &#8211; Axtone**  
The biggest tune of 2007? Yes, quite probably. [Axwell][18] takes us back to an early 90s breakbeat rave track with this anthem. Featuring a Faithless style arpeggio, some phat and funky breakbeats, some old school pianos and a great vocal from Charles Salter it was the monster tune of last summer. Rave on!

**[00:43:48] Armand Van Helden &#8211; NYC Beat (Original Mix) &#8211; Southern Fried Records**  
The year wouldn&#8217;t be complete without a killer track from [Armand Van Helden][19]! A dirty bassline? Check! A punk-funk 80s vocal? Check! Some dirty beats with some wicked percussion? Check! A massive tune? You bet!

**[00:49:03] Sia &#8211; The Girl You Lost To Cocaine (Stonebridge Club Mix) &#8211; Monkey Puzzle Records**  
The Swedish house music producer [Stonebridge][20] takes the surly [Sia][21] away from his usual piano-tinged remixes and gives us a filthy basslined monster. Amazing haunting vocals are layered on top of this tough house track and it became one of my favourite tunes of the year.

**[00:55:48] Coburn &#8211; Razorblade (Malente Remix) &#8211; Great Stuff**  
More tough stuff comes from those cheeky boys from the UK, [Coburn][22], who gave us 2005&#8242;s killer track &#8220;We Interrupt This Program&#8221;. &#8220;Like Kylie on acid&#8221; is how they describe the track and who am I to argue? Given a cheeky rerub by German producer [Malente][23] it builds up with a big old bassline and some bit crunched breakdowns. Club music for the world&#8217;s dirty dancefloor!

**[00:62:18] Bodyrox ft. Luciana &#8211; What Planet You On (The Slacksons Mix) &#8211; Phonetic Records**  
After the massive success of their track &#8220;Yeah Yeah&#8221; last year, [Bodyrox][24] are back with another huge electro house cut. [The Slacksons][25] turn this into a potential house music classic with it&#8217;s building bassline and twisting percussion. This is how all house music should be!

**[00:00:00] Axwell &#038; Sebastian Ingrosso vs. Salem Al Fakir &#8211; It&#8217;s True (Original Mix) &#8211; Axtone**  
And finally a somewhat under-exposed [Axtone][26] track which may get more play in the Ibiza in the summer of 2008. In my opinion it has the potential to be the new Stardust or Modjo. It&#8217;s a fun and funky summer tune which showcases Salem&#8217;s smooth vocals and Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso&#8217;s funkier house roots. You can&#8217;t help but smile when you hear the the electric guitar followed by the brilliantly simple &#8220;it&#8217;s true, life will smile for you&#8221; chorus. A great way to finish off my &#8220;best of 2007 mix&#8221;. Life will definitely smile for all of us in 2008.

So I hope you enjoyed this years, or should that be last years, &#8220;best of &#8230;&#8221; mix. I think they are all awesome and I hope you do too! Big love to you all for the support you give me and for all of the comments on the site. I hope 2008 brings more listeners and more funky house music!
