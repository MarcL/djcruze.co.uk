At last. A new podcast! Yes, yes, I know. As always it&#8217;s been far too long between podcasts but it&#8217;s finally here. Episode #37 of the DJ Cruze podcast brings you another hour of the slammingest (&#8230;that&#8217;s not a real word&#8230;) club tunes from the world of funky, chunky house and electro house. Also included is a DJ Cruze exclusive. On tonight&#8217;s show you&#8217;ll find the world exclusive play of my remix (known as the Funkfinders Remix) of World Of Colour&#8217;s new track &#8220;Change&#8221;. It&#8217;s a funky house remix in the Haji &#038; Emanuel or Simmons &#038; Christopher style and it&#8217;s got a big old string breakdown. Let me know what you thing of it in the comments below. It should be coming out as part of a remix package on Metrogroove Records so watch this space for more details.

Enjoy the show and [get in touch][3] if you want a shout out.
