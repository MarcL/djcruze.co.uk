It&#8217;s time for another hour of funk-filled tunes from DJ Cruze and tonight&#8217;s episode is no exception. I&#8217;m bringing you another show filled with the best house and electro tunes that are rocking my dancefloors at the moment. We&#8217;ve also got an exclusive from the up and coming Dutch producer [Duart Jansen][1] who brings us an awesome disco cut-up with his new tune &#8220;What U Want&#8221;. Thanks for giving me the track mate!

Also, the classic this week is a classic Hardfloor remix of Mory Kanté&#8217;s &#8220;Yeke Yeke&#8221; which has always been a massive tune for me. Great African vocals with the acid madness that only Hardfloor can supply. A wicked tune!

Enjoy the show and [get in touch][2] if you want a shout out. And don&#8217;t forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
