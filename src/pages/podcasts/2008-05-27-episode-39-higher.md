Has it really been over two months since I filled your iPods and MP3 players with funky house music? Yet again I am seriously sorry for not getting my hands and decks into action and getting you a mix of the most twisted and funky house and electro tunes around. Life's always hectic in the DJ Cruze household and this time it's been more hectic than usual. As a result I've decided that I need to get more sensible podcast schedule sorted for you so that you at find a new mix in your musical inbox at least once a month! Watch this space for more details.

So what have I got for you this month? Well, some massive tunes of course from some of my favourite artists and remixers from the past couple of months. We kick off the show with the absolutely massive disco-style anthem from The Whitest Boy Alive as remixed by the soon-to-be-legendary French producer Fred Falke. We've also got a great new tune from the prolific remixer Dave Spoon, a couple of great tunes by Mr. Ian Carey.

This month I also supply you with an exclusive new tune from yours truly, [DJ Cruze][1], in my Funkfinders guise. It's a remake of my old tune Cease which you originally heard on [Episode #14][2] of the DJ Cruze podcast, way back in April 2006 although it's now called &"Higher". It's lost the St. Ettiene sample and now features a brilliant new vocal from [Amber Dirks][3], a stunning singer songwriter from the US. She's added the funk and soul that the track needed and it should be released with 3 or 4 great remixes in the summer on [Metrogroove Records][4]. It's not quite finished yet but I thought you'd like to hear a sneak preview!

Also, the classic this week is a great disco cut-up from 1994 by Floorjam called &"Stoneage". In an exclusive hook-up with a great friend of mine, I've managed to secure some copies of this hard to find tune in his record store. If you head to First Rhythm records via [this link][5] you can get hold of Floorjam's &"Stoneage" for a great price and he'll deliver it to anywhere in the world! Being a really nice guy, he's also giving the DJ Cruze listeners a discount of 15% on orders over £30.00! Thanks Mark! So head there via any of the [links][5] on this page and put in the code **FRRSPEC1** when you check out. You'll save even more money! He's got loads of old tunes so you can expand your collection with some great old and new tunes. Hopefully we can get loads more of the Cruze Classics in his store for you as a lot of them are hard to find now. Big thanks go out to Mark and [First Rhythm Records][5] for supplying the Cruze Classic this week.

Enjoy the show and [get in touch][6] if you want a shout out. And don't forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
