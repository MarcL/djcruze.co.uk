Another podcast so quickly after the last one? Yeah, I don&#8217;t believe it either.

Here&#8217;s another slice of quality house tunes for your MP3 player from the DJ Cruze studios. There are some massive tracks on this week&#8217;s show. I&#8217;m loving the cheeky bootleg remix of Eric Prydz &#8220;Pjanoo&#8221; done by one of my favourite Swedish producers [Patrick L][1]. Sinden and Herve go crazy with the drums and horns in their new guise as Machines Don&#8217;t Care and their wicked track &#8220;Afrojacker&#8221;. Pump that one up loud. And what can I say about the Cruze Classic that is &#8220;Ultra Flava&#8221; by Farley and Heller? AWESOME! That&#8217;s what!

Enjoy the show and [get in touch][2] if you want a shout out. And don&#8217;t forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.

**Next podcast:** 20th July 2008. Don&#8217;t be late!
