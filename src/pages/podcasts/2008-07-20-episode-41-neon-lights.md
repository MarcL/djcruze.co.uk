It's supposed to be the summer here in the northern hemisphere but you wouldn't think it was with the amount of rain we've had in the UK in the past few weeks. So I'd better brighten up your day and mine with episode #41 of the DJ Cruze podcast. As always I've got some killer tunes for you and your MP3 player so make sure you crank them up loud.

In this episode I've got some hot house and electro house tracks for you and some awesome remixes from the usual suspects like Thomas Gold, Ian Carey and Axwell. One of the big tunes this week, and the title of this episode, is the new tune by Max Linen called &#8220;Neon Lights&#8221;. It's got a fantastic indie vocal and massive breakdown. Definitely, a hot tune for the summer.

Another big track is the new Axwell club mix of Adele's &#8220;Hometown Glory&#8221;. I loved this track when I first heard it on [Hype Machine][1] last year and was suprised that this wasn't the first track she released when she got signed to a major label. Axwell's club mix stays pretty true to the original and just adds some house beats and strings. It's a bit commercial but I absolutely love the track. If you're looking for a darker version then look out for his Remode remix instead.

I've also got a great bootleg mashup which I have [mentioned in the blog before][2]. It's a cheeky bootleg mix of Spitâ€™s â€œFallingâ€ (Daddyâ€™s Groove Magic Island mix) with the acapella from &#8220;Finally&#8221; by Kings of Tomorrow. It works really well, so much so that Hed Kandi have decided to put it on CD1 of their [Hed Kandi – The Mix: Summer 2008][3]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=djcr-21&l=ur2&o=2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> compilation. Kudos to Utopia and Jay Funk for coming up with it though! Check out [Utopia's podcast][4] too if you want even more quality house tunes.

And finally I've got an awesome classic for you. Satoshi Tomiie brings us a big room &#8220;Anthem&#8221; with his Black Shells guise. It was a massive tune for me back in 1994 and it still sounds huge today.

If you enjoy the show then [get in touch][5] and tell me what you think or want a shout out. Also, why not consider [donating some money][6] so that I can cover the costs of producing the show. With the amount of downloads I have, it's not cheap! And finally, don't forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
