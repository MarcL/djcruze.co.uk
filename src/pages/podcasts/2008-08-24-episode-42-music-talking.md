What a terrible month August has been. A couple of days of sun and plenty of rain. It&#8217;s horrible. So what better way to kick out the UK&#8217;s &#8220;summer&#8221; than episode #42 of the DJ Cruze podcast!

I&#8217;ve got another hour of funky and chunky house tunes for you to get your rumps shaking to! I thought I&#8217;d kick off this week&#8217;s show with some darker electro tunes that I&#8217;ve been enjoying over the past month. Thomas Gold gives us a moody remix of Morgan Page&#8217;s new track &#8220;Call My Name&#8221;. Next up is the Ian Carey remix of David Rubato&#8217;s &#8220;Deep Inside&#8221; which is one of Ian&#8217;s electro house mixes which he&#8217;s been churning out recently. We then have Sweden&#8217;s Dumb Dan on the remix of an apparently famous rock track (I believe) by Nerved.

As you can see from this week&#8217;s tracklisting there are loads of remixes from the German production duo Spencer &#038; Hill. Their remixes of Moby, R.I.O. and Giant Jr are rocking my box this month and I&#8217;m sure they will bring us even more funky house tunes before the end of the year. Also, check out the Young Punx remix of Giant Jr&#8217;s &#8220;I Want To Be Evil&#8221; if you like your dirty electro. It&#8217;s another wicked remix.

Two of the biggest tunes in my box this month are Platnum&#8217;s &#8220;Love Shy&#8221; remixed by the Soul Avengerz and Fred Falke&#8217;s remix of &#8220;Music Talking&#8221; by The Montanas and Roland Clark. The first is a massive piano driven remake of the old Kristine Blond classic. Then we&#8217;ve got a remix by my favourite producer at the moment, Fred Falke. He turns the track &#8220;Music Talking&#8221; into a French disco monster. When the bassline drops the crowd goes wild! A HUGE track!!

Next upI&#8217;ve got a new Dabruck &#038; Klein remix of &#8220;What A Wonderful World&#8221; by Axwell &#038; Bob Sinclar. This original version of this track caused quite a bit of comment on my blog as it was a love it or hate it track. This new version takes is down the electro house route and I think it works well. Finally we&#8217;ve got a DJ Cruze classic in the shape of &#8220;Into My Heart&#8221; by 6 by Six. I used to play both the original mix and also this bumping, piano remix by Grand Larceny. A classic which I&#8217;m sure the people who remember the party days at Vibration Club will remember!

If you enjoy the show then [get in touch][1] and tell me what you think or want a shout out. Also, why not consider [donating some money][2] so that I can cover the costs of producing the show. With the amount of downloads I have, it&#8217;s not cheap! And finally, don&#8217;t forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
