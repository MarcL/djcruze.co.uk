It&#8217;s time for another slice of funky house and chunky electro house to brighten up those dull days of autumn. What better way than episode #43 of the DJ Cruze podcast. It almost didn&#8217;t happen tonight due to a last minute hardware glitch but thankfully I managed to sort it out. I&#8217;ve just changed over to using my microphone via my laptop rather than an eight year old desktop PC which was feeling the strain but my audio interface decided it didn&#8217;t want to play nicely. Thankfully it&#8217;s all sorted now though.

So what&#8217;s on tonight&#8217;s show? Well, some awesome house tunes, that&#8217;s what! Kicking off the show we&#8217;ve got the awesome Phonat remix of the new Young Punx track called &#8220;Fire&#8221;. Phonat is an awesome Italian producer who always gives us top quality house tracks. Next up is a DJ Cruze exclusive! I&#8217;ve done given a house twist to an indie track by new band Empire Of The Sun. Their new track is called &#8220;Walking On A Dream&#8221; and I&#8217;ve turned an 80s synth pop track into a pumping French house tune with my Funkfinders Discoid Remix. Hopefully you&#8217;ll all like it but let me know what you think in the comments. It&#8217;s only a rough mix but once it&#8217;s finished I&#8217;ll post it online for you all to download.

The biggest track of the summer then turns up as I mix in DJ DLG and Erick Morrilo&#8217;s new track &#8220;Where Are You Now?&#8221; It&#8217;s the biggest summer anthem so make sure you turn it up loud! We&#8217;ve then got some nice and chunky electro house tracks from Deadmau5 and Shelltoe Allstars. Looks like the summer of 2008 is the time for hip-house to come back into fashion and I love it! Funkerman then gives us a mean and moody house track with &#8220;One For Me&#8221;. It reminds me of Fedde Le Grande&#8217;s remix of Camille Jones &#8220;The Creeps&#8221; and it&#8217;ll rock any dancefloor.

Another couple of dancefloor bombs appear in the form of Mark Knight and Funkerman&#8217;s remake of the Laurent Garnier classic &#8220;The Man With The Red Face&#8221;. The new Morris T remix is rocking my dancefloor at the moment. Then top Polish house producers Wawa team up with UK DJ Jason Herd with their latest track &#8220;The Right Way&#8221;. Another dancefloor slayer with a top electro house remix from Germany&#8217;s Chris Ortega.

Finally I&#8217;ve taken it back to the old school this month. Skynet UK give us a retro-sounding electro house track &#8220;Back To 89&#8243; with it&#8217;s old school synth stabs and vocal snippets. After playing that I couldn&#8217;t end the show without an old school Cruze Classic and I&#8217;m giving you the breakbeat monster that is &#8220;Bomb Scare&#8221; by 2 Bad Mice. An awesome breakbeat (or hardcore as we used to call it back in 1991) anthem which still rocks clubs for me even now. Who&#8217;d believe it was 17 years old!

I hope that these tunes keep you coming back for more!

**Update:** Seems like I didn&#8217;t completely check the audio and there&#8217;s been a bit of the Cruze Classic repeated which I hadn&#8217;t realised when I mixed it down to a WAV file to add the vocals. Sorry about that!  
**Update 2:** It&#8217;s now fixed.

If you enjoy the show then [get in touch][2] and tell me what you think or want a shout out. Also, why not consider [donating some money][3] so that I can cover the costs of producing the show. With the amount of downloads I have, it&#8217;s not cheap! And finally, don&#8217;t forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
