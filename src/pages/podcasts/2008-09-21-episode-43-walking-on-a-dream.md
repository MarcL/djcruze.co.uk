It's time for another slice of funky house and chunky electro house to brighten up those dull days of autumn. What better way than episode #43 of the DJ Cruze podcast. It almost didn't happen tonight due to a last minute hardware glitch but thankfully I managed to sort it out. I've just changed over to using my microphone via my laptop rather than an eight year old desktop PC which was feeling the strain but my audio interface decided it didn't want to play nicely. Thankfully it's all sorted now though.

So what's on tonight's show? Well, some awesome house tunes, that's what! Kicking off the show we've got the awesome Phonat remix of the new Young Punx track called &"Fire". Phonat is an awesome Italian producer who always gives us top quality house tracks. Next up is a DJ Cruze exclusive! I've done given a house twist to an indie track by new band Empire Of The Sun. Their new track is called &"Walking On A Dream" and I've turned an 80s synth pop track into a pumping French house tune with my Funkfinders Discoid Remix. Hopefully you'll all like it but let me know what you think in the comments. It's only a rough mix but once it's finished I'll post it online for you all to download.

The biggest track of the summer then turns up as I mix in DJ DLG and Erick Morrilo's new track &"Where Are You Now?" It's the biggest summer anthem so make sure you turn it up loud! We've then got some nice and chunky electro house tracks from Deadmau5 and Shelltoe Allstars. Looks like the summer of 2008 is the time for hip-house to come back into fashion and I love it! Funkerman then gives us a mean and moody house track with &"One For Me". It reminds me of Fedde Le Grande's remix of Camille Jones &"The Creeps" and it'll rock any dancefloor.

Another couple of dancefloor bombs appear in the form of Mark Knight and Funkerman's remake of the Laurent Garnier classic &"The Man With The Red Face". The new Morris T remix is rocking my dancefloor at the moment. Then top Polish house producers Wawa team up with UK DJ Jason Herd with their latest track &"The Right Way". Another dancefloor slayer with a top electro house remix from Germany's Chris Ortega.

Finally I've taken it back to the old school this month. Skynet UK give us a retro-sounding electro house track &"Back To 89&#8243; with it's old school synth stabs and vocal snippets. After playing that I couldn't end the show without an old school Cruze Classic and I'm giving you the breakbeat monster that is &"Bomb Scare" by 2 Bad Mice. An awesome breakbeat (or hardcore as we used to call it back in 1991) anthem which still rocks clubs for me even now. Who'd believe it was 17 years old!

I hope that these tunes keep you coming back for more!

**Update:** Seems like I didn't completely check the audio and there's been a bit of the Cruze Classic repeated which I hadn't realised when I mixed it down to a WAV file to add the vocals. Sorry about that!  
**Update 2:** It's now fixed.

If you enjoy the show then [get in touch][2] and tell me what you think or want a shout out. Also, why not consider [donating some money][3] so that I can cover the costs of producing the show. With the amount of downloads I have, it's not cheap! And finally, don't forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
