Episode #44 of the DJ Cruze Podcast has come a few days later than I promised. Sorry about that. I had a throat infection last week and sounded like a bad Barry White impersonator. I'm sure you'd have pulled your earphones out of your ears had you heard a podcast with that voice on it. So better late than never we've got episode #44 of the podcast with plenty of funky and chunky tunes for your listening pleasure!

Kicking off the show we've got some electro house fun from Spencer and Hill followed by a great new track from Dave Spoon and Funkagenda. Plenty of synth basslines and some lovely piano and strings. Then we've got a great new remix of The Shapeshifter's classic "Lola's Theme". They've taken it into the electro house realm with their 2008 re-edit but I still think it works well.

We've also got a few remixes of old classics from Shakedown and Toni Di Bart, both of which still keep the original vibe but with 2008 production values. Lovely! Ending the show we've got a killer Cruze Classic from Jimi Polo with "Better Days". It's a wicked remix by Sasha, back when he used to make piano tunes rather than his progressive sound of today. An awesome track which I have caned for years! Enjoy!

If you enjoy the show then [get in touch][2] and tell me what you think or want a shout out. Also, why not consider [donating some money][3] so that I can cover the costs of producing the show. With the amount of downloads I have, it's not cheap! And finally, don't forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.

The image is from my record collection. Ah, the good old days of vinyl!
