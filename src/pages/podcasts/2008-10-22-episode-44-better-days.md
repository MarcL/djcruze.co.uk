Episode #44 of the DJ Cruze Podcast has come a few days later than I promised. Sorry about that. I had a throat infection last week and sounded like a bad Barry White impersonator. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d have pulled your earphones out of your ears had you heard a podcast with that voice on it. So better late than never we&#8217;ve got episode #44 of the podcast with plenty of funky and chunky tunes for your listening pleasure!

Kicking off the show we&#8217;ve got some electro house fun from Spencer and Hill followed by a great new track from Dave Spoon and Funkagenda. Plenty of synth basslines and some lovely piano and strings. Then we&#8217;ve got a great new remix of The Shapeshifter&#8217;s classic &#8220;Lola&#8217;s Theme&#8221;. They&#8217;ve taken it into the electro house realm with their 2008 re-edit but I still think it works well.

We&#8217;ve also got a few remixes of old classics from Shakedown and Toni Di Bart, both of which still keep the original vibe but with 2008 production values. Lovely! Ending the show we&#8217;ve got a killer Cruze Classic from Jimi Polo with &#8220;Better Days&#8221;. It&#8217;s a wicked remix by Sasha, back when he used to make piano tunes rather than his progressive sound of today. An awesome track which I have caned for years! Enjoy!

If you enjoy the show then [get in touch][2] and tell me what you think or want a shout out. Also, why not consider [donating some money][3] so that I can cover the costs of producing the show. With the amount of downloads I have, it&#8217;s not cheap! And finally, don&#8217;t forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
