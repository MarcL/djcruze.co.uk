Wow! I&#8217;ve actually managed to post episode #45 of the DJ Cruze Podcast early. It&#8217;s unheard of! Yes, I managed to get some free time this week to do the mix and record the vocals for the show so I&#8217;m putting the DJ Cruze podcast online at the start of the day rather than the end. In the words of Hannibal from the A-Team: &#8220;I love it when a plan comes together!&#8221;

So what&#8217;s on this week&#8217;s podcast then? Well, I&#8217;ve got some phat and funky tunes for you that&#8217;s for sure. Kicking off the show there&#8217;s a great remix of indie band The Hours by Calvin Harris. He turns &#8220;See The Light&#8221; from an indie guitar tune into a great house track. I love the bad scratching of their piano riff. It works really well. Then we move onto Chris Lake&#8217;s latest track &#8220;Only One&#8221;. Scottish house producer Chris Lake never fails to deliver the goods and this is a pumping electro house track with a great haunting vocal.

German producers Spencer and Hill feature heavily this month with two tracks off their &#8220;Most Wanted EP&#8221; on Tiger Records. Solid electro house tracks as always from these guys. Man of the moment Deadmau5 brings the title of this month&#8217;s prodcast with his epic electro houser &#8220;Ghost N Stuff&#8221;. Look out for the cheeky bootleg re-edit by Funkfinders (aka DJ Cruze aka me) with the extended breakdown and hat-tip to the new President elect of the United States. Finally you guys get someone who (hopefully) knows what he&#8217;s doing!

The podcast then heads into old-school rave territory with tracks from The Young Punx and Rob Freejak. I&#8217;m loving the old breakbeat driven rave-influenced tunes that these guys have come up with. Some of the so-called fidgety rave house tracks that are out there leave me a bit cold but these two come up trumps. We&#8217;ve also got a killer house track from Bimbo Jones with hot UK producer eSquire on the remix. Quality percussion and a great vocal on the track &#8220;And I Try&#8221;. ESquire is one of the hottest UK house producers around so make sure you check him out.

The Cruze Classic this week is an awesome house remix of Jamiroquai&#8217;s &#8220;Space Cowboy&#8221; by David Morales. A wicked track that stayed in my box for many years and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll love hearing it again. And that&#8217;s about it so I hope you enjoy the tunes on the podcast.

If you enjoy the show then [get in touch][2] and tell me what you think or want a shout out. Also, why not consider [donating some money][3] so that I can cover the costs of producing the show. With the amount of downloads I have, it&#8217;s not cheap! And finally, don&#8217;t forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
