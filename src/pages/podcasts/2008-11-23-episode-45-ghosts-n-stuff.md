Wow! I've actually managed to post episode #45 of the DJ Cruze Podcast early. It's unheard of! Yes, I managed to get some free time this week to do the mix and record the vocals for the show so I'm putting the DJ Cruze podcast online at the start of the day rather than the end. In the words of Hannibal from the A-Team: &"I love it when a plan comes together!"

So what's on this week's podcast then? Well, I've got some phat and funky tunes for you that's for sure. Kicking off the show there's a great remix of indie band The Hours by Calvin Harris. He turns &"See The Light" from an indie guitar tune into a great house track. I love the bad scratching of their piano riff. It works really well. Then we move onto Chris Lake's latest track &"Only One". Scottish house producer Chris Lake never fails to deliver the goods and this is a pumping electro house track with a great haunting vocal.

German producers Spencer and Hill feature heavily this month with two tracks off their &"Most Wanted EP" on Tiger Records. Solid electro house tracks as always from these guys. Man of the moment Deadmau5 brings the title of this month's prodcast with his epic electro houser &"Ghost N Stuff". Look out for the cheeky bootleg re-edit by Funkfinders (aka DJ Cruze aka me) with the extended breakdown and hat-tip to the new President elect of the United States. Finally you guys get someone who (hopefully) knows what he's doing!

The podcast then heads into old-school rave territory with tracks from The Young Punx and Rob Freejak. I'm loving the old breakbeat driven rave-influenced tunes that these guys have come up with. Some of the so-called fidgety rave house tracks that are out there leave me a bit cold but these two come up trumps. We've also got a killer house track from Bimbo Jones with hot UK producer eSquire on the remix. Quality percussion and a great vocal on the track &"And I Try". ESquire is one of the hottest UK house producers around so make sure you check him out.

The Cruze Classic this week is an awesome house remix of Jamiroquai's &"Space Cowboy" by David Morales. A wicked track that stayed in my box for many years and I'm sure you'll love hearing it again. And that's about it so I hope you enjoy the tunes on the podcast.

If you enjoy the show then [get in touch][2] and tell me what you think or want a shout out. Also, why not consider [donating some money][3] so that I can cover the costs of producing the show. With the amount of downloads I have, it's not cheap! And finally, don't forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think.
