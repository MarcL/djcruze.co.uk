Here is Episode #46 of the DJ Cruze Podcast or &#8220;The Christmas Podcast&#8221; as it&#8217;s sometimes known. It&#8217;s a couple of days late due to some Christmas partying but don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s packed full of slamming house beats for you to enjoy while you tuck into your turkey, goose or whatever poultry you might be eating during the festive season.

So what&#8217;s on the show this week then? Well, we&#8217;ve got some massive house tracks from the past month as always. Kicking off the show is my cheeky Christmas bootleg. In case you don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve made it a tradition to make a house remix of a Christmas track since the first one back in December 2005. What started off as a quick sample and drum loop back with my [Nat King Cole bootleg][2] has quickly become a bigger studio project for me. It was tricky to choose the track for this year and it was a toss up between Cliff Richard&#8217;s &#8220;Miseltoe and Wine&#8221; and East 17&#8242;s &#8220;Stay Another Day&#8221; and the latter won (because Cliff&#8217;s song is in 3/4 timing and was too tricky to work with! Haha!) I&#8217;ve turned this UK Christmas classic that we hear on the radio 24-7 through December, into a pumping electro house track. Hope you enjoy it and I&#8217;ll stick it online for you to download in the new year.

Other hot tracks on this show are the new electro house track from Bodyrox and a great new tune from hot Scottish producer Chris Lake called &#8220;If You Knew&#8221;. Following that we have two absolutely massive tracks. First up it&#8217;s the Arias remix of Arno Cost&#8217;s new track called &#8220;Souvenir&#8221;. It&#8217;s a blindingly brilliant French production which tears the floor off any club. After that we&#8217;ve got the hot new track from Super Mal and Phonat who have come together to give us the massive &#8220;Pixelated&#8221;. A wicked breakdown and a superb bassline make it a winner for me.

We&#8217;ve also got a DJ Cruze exclusive tune from Simone Denny called &#8220;Addicted&#8221; which has been remixed by my main man Dean Saunders from World Of Colour and Metrogroove records. He&#8217;s giving us a great retro-house remix with storming pianos and a great trumpet break. To finish the show I&#8217;ve got a superb Cruze Classic from way back in 1994 called &#8220;Sexy Dancer&#8221; by The Rockford Files. It samples the breakbeat classic &#8220;Feel Real Good&#8221; by Manix and used to get those hands in the air every time I played it. A brilliant 90s house track which still makes me smile when I hear it today.

Don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;ll be back in a week with the &#8220;Best of 2008&#8243; podcast and then the DJ Cruze podcast returns to its regular schedule in January 2009. I&#8217;ll post a list of podcast dates over Christmas so you know what to expect in the new year. So make sure you all have a fantastic Christmas and New Year and the DJ Cruze podcast will be back with plenty of new tunes to rock your iPods and MP3 players. And if you&#8217;re buying anyone an iPod for Christmas then make sure you tell them to subscribe to the podcast for some rocking house beats.
