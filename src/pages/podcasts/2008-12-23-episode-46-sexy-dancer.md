Here is Episode #46 of the DJ Cruze Podcast or "The Christmas Podcast" as it's sometimes known. It's a couple of days late due to some Christmas partying but don't worry, it's packed full of slamming house beats for you to enjoy while you tuck into your turkey, goose or whatever poultry you might be eating during the festive season.

So what's on the show this week then? Well, we've got some massive house tracks from the past month as always. Kicking off the show is my cheeky Christmas bootleg. In case you don't know, I've made it a tradition to make a house remix of a Christmas track since the first one back in December 2005. What started off as a quick sample and drum loop back with my [Nat King Cole bootleg][2] has quickly become a bigger studio project for me. It was tricky to choose the track for this year and it was a toss up between Cliff Richard's "Miseltoe and Wine" and East 17's "Stay Another Day" and the latter won (because Cliff's song is in 3/4 timing and was too tricky to work with! Haha!) I've turned this UK Christmas classic that we hear on the radio 24-7 through December, into a pumping electro house track. Hope you enjoy it and I'll stick it online for you to download in the new year.

Other hot tracks on this show are the new electro house track from Bodyrox and a great new tune from hot Scottish producer Chris Lake called "If You Knew". Following that we have two absolutely massive tracks. First up it's the Arias remix of Arno Cost's new track called "Souvenir". It's a blindingly brilliant French production which tears the floor off any club. After that we've got the hot new track from Super Mal and Phonat who have come together to give us the massive "Pixelated". A wicked breakdown and a superb bassline make it a winner for me.

We've also got a DJ Cruze exclusive tune from Simone Denny called "Addicted" which has been remixed by my main man Dean Saunders from World Of Colour and Metrogroove records. He's giving us a great retro-house remix with storming pianos and a great trumpet break. To finish the show I've got a superb Cruze Classic from way back in 1994 called "Sexy Dancer" by The Rockford Files. It samples the breakbeat classic "Feel Real Good" by Manix and used to get those hands in the air every time I played it. A brilliant 90s house track which still makes me smile when I hear it today.

Don't forget that I'll be back in a week with the "Best of 2008" podcast and then the DJ Cruze podcast returns to its regular schedule in January 2009. I'll post a list of podcast dates over Christmas so you know what to expect in the new year. So make sure you all have a fantastic Christmas and New Year and the DJ Cruze podcast will be back with plenty of new tunes to rock your iPods and MP3 players. And if you're buying anyone an iPod for Christmas then make sure you tell them to subscribe to the podcast for some rocking house beats.
