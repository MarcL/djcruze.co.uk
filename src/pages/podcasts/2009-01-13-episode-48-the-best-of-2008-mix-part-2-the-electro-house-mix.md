Here&#8217;s part 2 of my &#8220;Best Of 2008 Mix&#8221; and it&#8217;s 70 minutes of electro and progressive house goodness! There were plenty of great tougher house tracks in 2008 and hopefully I&#8217;ve chosen the best ones for you.

### Best Of 2008 Mix &#8211; The Electro House Mix Tracklisting

#### [00:00:00] Marco Demark feat Casey Barnes &#8211; Tiny Dancer (John Dahlbäck Mix) &#8211; 3Beat Blue

Tiny Dancer is one of my favourite Elton John tracks and this electro house version was a big hit in 2008 for Marco Demark (and not Marco Denmark as I called him for a long time!) Hot Swedish tech-house producer John Dahlbäck turned this track into a jumpy electro house track with a nice breakdown. Lovely!

#### [00:05:39] Pryda &#8211; Rafunk &#8211; Pryda

Ask most people who the hottest electro house producer of 2008 was and I&#8217;d guarantee that a high percentage would say Sweden&#8217;s Eric Prydz. The Swedish House Mafia producer released so many high quality tracks in 2008, most on his Pryda label, and &#8220;Rafunk&#8221; is no exception. A chunky and funky bassline and some haunting strings make this a winner.

#### [00:10:22] Deadmau5 &#8211; Hi Friend (Original Mix) &#8211; Mau5trap

Ask the people who didn&#8217;t say Eric Prydz was the hottest electro house producer of 2008 who it was and they would probably have told you Deadmau5 instead. The hot Canadian producer blew up to be one of the most in-demand DJs and producers in 2008, producing loads of big tracks and remixes. The track &#8220;Hi Friend&#8221; features MC Flipside on vocals and takes hip-house into the 21st century with its dirty beats and bassline. A massive track!

#### [00:15:49] ATFC feat Yasmeen &#8211; Tell U Y (New Jack Swing Original) &#8211; Strictly

Aydin The Funki Chilli has been a huge house music producer since the mid 90s and has always featured heavily in my charts. This year ATFC reinvented himself, moving away from the older disco-house sound and moved into tougher, electro house territory. This track came out towards the end of the year and features a dirty, bouncing bassline and a great vocal.

#### [00:21:43] Inkfish &#038; David West &#8211; Hello Piano (Sébastien Léger Remix) &#8211; Mistakes Music

Another big French house producer blew up in 2008 and Sébastien Léger was his name. He&#8217;s been around since the late 90s and like AFTC, made a name for himself with more of a disco-cut up house sound. In the past few years he&#8217;s been playing and producing a tougher, tech-house sound and this track on his own Mistakes Music label is a great example of his work. A progressive house track which builds and builds and finally drops down into an epic breakdown.

#### [00:28:07] Passenger 10 &#8211; Mirage (EDX&#8217;s 5un5hine Remix) &#8211; White

Swiss producer EDX is another of 2008&#8242;s success stories and last year was the year he became a household name for his remixes and productions. His name appear on remixes for lots of bigger named artists and his productions had a similar feel to Deadmau5&#8242;s production style. Passenger 10&#8242;s &#8220;Mirage&#8221; rocked my floors with its building bassline and awesome strings.

#### [00:34:35] Buy Now &#8211; Body Crash (Laidback Luke&#8217;s Remix) &#8211; La Mode

Dutch producer Laidback Luke had a fantastic year in 2008 and his remix of &#8220;Body Crash&#8221; by Buy Now (aka Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso) was huge. Featuring a disco sample of [&#8220;Let&#8217;s All Chant&#8221;][4] and a dark and moody bit-crushed bassline it featured in the charts of all of the A-list DJs.

#### [00:40:18] Arno Cost &#038; Norman Doray &#8211; Apocalypse (Sébastien Léger Remix) &#8211; CR2

This is probably one of my favourite tracks of 2008. Young French house producers Arno Cost and Norman Doray gave us &#8220;Apocalypse&#8221; and Sébastien Léger turned it into an anthem! Awesome arpeggiated synths take us to a massive breakdown. A fantastic track.

#### [00:48:11] Erick Morillo &#038; DJ DLG &#8211; Where Are You Now (Original Mix) &#8211; Subliminal

This was the summer anthem in Ibiza and was hammered by loads of the top DJs. Canada&#8217;s DJ DLG teamed up with the [infamous Erick Morillo][5] for this electro house monster. Check out [Morillo dropping it at WMC][6] to see the crowd&#8217;s reaction.

#### [00:57:18] Dirty South &#038; Axwell &#8211; Open Your Heart (Vocal Mix) &#8211; Axtone

Two of the biggest producers, Dirty South and Axwell, teamed up to bring us this massive electro house track on Axwell&#8217;s Axtone label. Featuring an old school vocal, a massive bassline and big strings it blew up big time and cemented both producers reputations for producing anthems.

#### [01:04:25] Sebastian Ingrosso &#038; Laidback Luke &#8211; Chaa Chaa (EDX&#8217;s Marakesh Souk Remix) &#8211; Size

EDX gave us another great remix of Sebastian Ingrosso and Laidback Luke&#8217;s &#8220;Chaa Chaa&#8221;. It ends my electro house mix with a quality progressive house track with EDX&#8217;s trademark string sound. A great end to a year of quality electronic house music.

So I hope you enjoyed the tougher &#8220;Best Of 2008&#8243; Electro House Mix as much as the [&#8220;Best Of 2008&#8243; house mix][7] too. Hopefully 2009 will bring us another year of top notch tracks and I look forward to compiling the &#8220;Best Of 2009&#8243; mix next year.
