As always it&#8217;s been far too long since the last podcast. After making two best of mixes (part 1 and part 2) for you I decided to not publish a podcast in January to give me a brief rest! But I&#8217;m back now with another hour of funky and chunky house music for 2009.

So kicking off the show this week is a great new track from Jimmy D Robinson, a grammy nominated musician and poet, with a funky remix from Josh Harris. Coming in after that is the Bimbo Jones remix of the classic Kid Kudi vs Crookers track &#8220;Day N Night&#8221;. He turns out a wicked melancholic house remix which is a great contrast to the original. Following that there&#8217;s a heavy hitter from Doman and Gooding with their Carrie Lucas sampling &#8220;Runnin&#8217;&#8221;. The Ian Carey remix is the one that&#8217;s doing it for me and he brings out the pumping electro house bassline line along with the massive strings sample.

The biggest tracks for me on this show are Super Mal&#8217;s &#8220;Dow Dow&#8221; and Wolfgang Gartner&#8217;s &#8220;Flashback&#8221;. The former is a massive house track with a funky bassline and brilliant bit-crushed synth chords. I love it. And a big thanks to [Sascha Lupeski][2] for the tip on the Wolfgang Gartner track. Make sure you download his podcast too. You&#8217;ll love it it you love your house music phat and funky!

There&#8217;s also a DJ Cruze exclusive of a Bimbo Jones track called &#8220;Come On (Up)&#8221; which was sent to me by Lee Dagger from Bimbo Jones. It&#8217;s a bit of slow burner and it&#8217;s not the instant hit that some of their previous tracks gives you. I still think it&#8217;s a wicked track that you&#8217;ll grow to love. Finishing off the show this week is a huge Cruze Classic from Helicopter called &#8220;On Ya Way&#8221;. I can&#8217;t even begin to tell you how many times I&#8217;ve played that track over the years. A massive disco-house monster!

So I hope you enjoy this week&#8217;s DJ Cruze podcast and I&#8217;ll be back in March with more of the same. Don&#8217;t forget to comment on the show below and tell me what you think of the tunes.
