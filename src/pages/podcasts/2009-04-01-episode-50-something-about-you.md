So how did March slip away without a DJ Cruze podcast?! Thankfully I've managed to get it done in time for the start of April though. So here we are with episode #50 of the DJ Cruze podcast and there are plenty of big tunes for you on this show.

Kicking off the show we've got the new track from Groove Armada who are back with a joint venture with Barcadi and their B-Live label. It's a slice of indie-rock house music with a great remix from Rio De Janeiro's The Twelves. Then my main man Fred Falke gives us the goods with his soulful remake of City Life's "San Francisco". A fantastic house track with a laid back electric piano vibe.

The Soul Avengerz bring us some more funky house with a pumping bassline which is then followed by a new UK singer called Emma Deigman. London's Alex Blanco is on the mix and he gives us some funky keys and a chunky bassline. One of my favourite tracks of the moment comes from the US producers Live Element (aka Hott 22). They've cut-up a sample from Excile's "I Want To Kiss You All Over" for their new track "Something About You" and they give us a monster disco house track. I love it!

Canada's DJ DLG is always on top form with a big remix of Disco Wheel's "Good Times". It's a similar feel to his summer 2008 smash "Where Are You Now?" but that's not a bad thing. After that we've got a hot track from the big Dutch producer Dennis Christopher but with a cut-up electro house remix from the UK production team Dirty Secretz. I think they're going to be big in 2009. Another Dutchman, Laidback Luke, then gives us a wicked rework of the 1978 track from The Korgis with it's massive piano breakdown.

Finally we finish off the show with a massive progressive house track from Sweden's Eric Prydz on his Pryda Recordings label. "Miami To Atlanta" has been heavily bootlegged on the net since a ripped version from one of his DJ sets appear in the middle of last year. Thankfully he's finally released it and given it a bit of a rework since then and it's set to be one of the biggest tunes of the year. The Cruze Classic for this week is an awesome old breakbeat track called "Lock Up" by Zero B. Originally released in 1991 it was a hot tune for me back in the 90s with it's dubby bassline, sloppy breakbeats and hands-in-the-air breakdown.

So enjoy this month's show and don't forget to comment below and tell me what you think of the tunes.
