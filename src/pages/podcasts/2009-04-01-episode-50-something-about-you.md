So how did March slip away without a DJ Cruze podcast?! Thankfully I&#8217;ve managed to get it done in time for the start of April though. So here we are with episode #50 of the DJ Cruze podcast and there are plenty of big tunes for you on this show.

Kicking off the show we&#8217;ve got the new track from Groove Armada who are back with a joint venture with Barcadi and their B-Live label. It&#8217;s a slice of indie-rock house music with a great remix from Rio De Janeiro&#8217;s The Twelves. Then my main man Fred Falke gives us the goods with his soulful remake of City Life&#8217;s &#8220;San Francisco&#8221;. A fantastic house track with a laid back electric piano vibe.

The Soul Avengerz bring us some more funky house with a pumping bassline which is then followed by a new UK singer called Emma Deigman. London&#8217;s Alex Blanco is on the mix and he gives us some funky keys and a chunky bassline. One of my favourite tracks of the moment comes from the US producers Live Element (aka Hott 22). They&#8217;ve cut-up a sample from Excile&#8217;s &#8220;I Want To Kiss You All Over&#8221; for their new track &#8220;Something About You&#8221; and they give us a monster disco house track. I love it!

Canada&#8217;s DJ DLG is always on top form with a big remix of Disco Wheel&#8217;s &#8220;Good Times&#8221;. It&#8217;s a similar feel to his summer 2008 smash &#8220;Where Are You Now?&#8221; but that&#8217;s not a bad thing. After that we&#8217;ve got a hot track from the big Dutch producer Dennis Christopher but with a cut-up electro house remix from the UK production team Dirty Secretz. I think they&#8217;re going to be big in 2009. Another Dutchman, Laidback Luke, then gives us a wicked rework of the 1978 track from The Korgis with it&#8217;s massive piano breakdown.

Finally we finish off the show with a massive progressive house track from Sweden&#8217;s Eric Prydz on his Pryda Recordings label. &#8220;Miami To Atlanta&#8221; has been heavily bootlegged on the net since a ripped version from one of his DJ sets appear in the middle of last year. Thankfully he&#8217;s finally released it and given it a bit of a rework since then and it&#8217;s set to be one of the biggest tunes of the year. The Cruze Classic for this week is an awesome old breakbeat track called &#8220;Lock Up&#8221; by Zero B. Originally released in 1991 it was a hot tune for me back in the 90s with it&#8217;s dubby bassline, sloppy breakbeats and hands-in-the-air breakdown.

So enjoy this month&#8217;s show and don&#8217;t forget to comment below and tell me what you think of the tunes.
