Here you go. Another hour of funky house, twisted disco and electro beats all served up in a handy little package we call the DJ Cruze Podcast Episode #52. I&#8217;ve thankfully managed to get it done in a month too which is always good!

As most people have probably realised, I name each of the shows after one of my favourite tunes in the podcast and this month I chose Haji &#038; Emanuel&#8217;s &#8220;In The Moment&#8221; as the name of the show as it&#8217;s one of my favourite tracks in the mix. Never has a title been so apt as for this month&#8217;s show. I&#8217;ve been DJ&#8217;ing in Germany for over 16 years now and I&#8217;m met many people in my time over there. I had the pleasure to party with many people and sadly I found out last week that someone I knew, an ex-boyfriend of a good friend of mine, has died. His name was [Philipp Lehberger][2] but was better know as &#8220;Willy&#8221;. He died a tragic death after a fall whilst trying to break up a fight. I hadn&#8217;t seen him in four or five years but I still remember him with fond memories. He was a funny guy and great to chat to. He also liked to drink JÃ¤germeister with me and I&#8217;m a man who always enjoy drinking that with my German friends. In fact I&#8217;m probably going to drink a JÃ¤germeister in his honour once this podcast is uploaded! So it&#8217;s poignant that the title &#8220;In The Moment&#8221; sort of sums up how life should be lived and probably how he lived his life. Make sure you live life to the full and &#8220;in the moment&#8221; as you never know what&#8217;s round the corner. This month&#8217;s podcast is dedicated to his memory. RIP Willy. Mach&#8217;s gut.

As always, there are plenty of massive tunes in the show this month. We&#8217;ve got some dirty electro house from the likes of Spencer &#038; Hill, Fedde Le Grand and Jean Elan. We&#8217;ve got some twisted cut-up disco madness from Don Diablo. We&#8217;ve got deeper house tracks from the likes of Michael Grey and Danism, Haji &#038; Emanuel and The Viron Ltd. Hey, we&#8217;ve even got a massive cheeky remix of Beethoven&#8217;s 5th Symphony from Wolfgang Gartner. We cater for all tastes on this show!

Finally, I&#8217;ve got to apologise for some of the vocals in this show. It sounds a bit like I&#8217;m slurring my words. No, I wasn&#8217;t drinking &#8211; it was just that the battery was going in the microphone I was using and I didn&#8217;t realise until I&#8217;d finished most of the vocals. It was too much work to re-record them all so I&#8217;ve left them as is.

So enjoy this month&#8217;s show and don&#8217;t forget to comment below and tell me what you think of the tunes.
