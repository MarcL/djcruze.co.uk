It's been a busy month for me at DJ Cruze towers and episode #53 of the DJ Cruze month just misses July 2009 by a couple of days. Apologies for this episode being a bit late. I've had to contend with a house move, and hence very little free time while we unpack, and a lack of internet connection! But we're finally in our new house and things are starting to settle down so it's time for another selection of hot house tunes, promotional tracks from some hot house producers and plenty of chunky electro house beats. I've made this podcast a bit longer to try and make up for the delay.

So what have I got in store for you this month? Well, kicking off the show we've got a new promo mix of Calvin Harris' new track &"Ready For The Weekend". Dave Spoon takes it out on a dirty breakbeat journey and I've been loving this track. Next up for we've got a hot promo from Funkstar Deluxe which came from my good friends over at Supratron in Germany. A wicked progressive / electro house track which is working for me.

We've also got some killer latin house collaborations from legendary house DJ Graeme Park and Nick Hussey and hot house producers Chris Lake and Lys. I'm loving their percussion driven piano and horn tracks &"Samba Party" and &"La Tromba". Wolfgang Gartner is a producer who is featuring in almost every podcast and this month he's given us a hot rework of MSTRKRFT's &"Heartbreaker". Following that we've got a fantastic remix of the new Basement Jaxx track &"Raindrops" by Funkagenda and Paul Thomas. Check out the wicked breakdown and vocoded vocals!

Australia's TV Rock give us a hot house tune &"In The Air" which Axwell has remixed into a tune which should have been called &"Hands In The Air"!! An awesome remix as always by the hard-working Swede. I then threw a couple of old school sounding house tunes in the mix as I'm really enjoying the old piano tracks. First up is the new track from Benny Royal who takes us on an old school piano journey with &"Pada Papaya". Then we've got a hot new track from Barcelona's The Requesters and their track &"Chrisis". A new school version of an old school rave track with cut-up pianos and old school samples. I love the bassline on it too! Awesome!

To end this month's show I've gone a bit more pumping with a deep and dirty electro house track from Robbie Rivera. I love the horns and spoken word vocal on his track &"Move Move". After that is a cheeky reworking of Baby D's &"Let Me Be Your Fantasy". He's turned the old breakbeat track into a pumping electro house monster. Up next is the new release on Seamus Haji's Big Love label called &"I've Been Looking". As always Seamus Haji turns out a fantastic track with a killer progressive house remix from French producer Romain Curtis.

There was only one artist that I could choose for this month's Cruze classic after the sad passing of Michael Jackson back in June 2009. I've always been a fan of his music and the house remix of &"Smooth Criminal" by Brothers In Rhythm was always a huge track for me back in the day. Plenty of funky drums, police sirens and the massive bassline and vocals help this to be a great remix. Enjoy!

I hope you like the tracks on this month's show and don't forget to comment below and tell me what you think of them.
