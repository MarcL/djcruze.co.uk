It&#8217;s been a busy month for me at DJ Cruze towers and episode #53 of the DJ Cruze month just misses July 2009 by a couple of days. Apologies for this episode being a bit late. I&#8217;ve had to contend with a house move, and hence very little free time while we unpack, and a lack of internet connection! But we&#8217;re finally in our new house and things are starting to settle down so it&#8217;s time for another selection of hot house tunes, promotional tracks from some hot house producers and plenty of chunky electro house beats. I&#8217;ve made this podcast a bit longer to try and make up for the delay.

So what have I got in store for you this month? Well, kicking off the show we&#8217;ve got a new promo mix of Calvin Harris&#8217; new track &#8220;Ready For The Weekend&#8221;. Dave Spoon takes it out on a dirty breakbeat journey and I&#8217;ve been loving this track. Next up for we&#8217;ve got a hot promo from Funkstar Deluxe which came from my good friends over at Supratron in Germany. A wicked progressive / electro house track which is working for me.

We&#8217;ve also got some killer latin house collaborations from legendary house DJ Graeme Park and Nick Hussey and hot house producers Chris Lake and Lys. I&#8217;m loving their percussion driven piano and horn tracks &#8220;Samba Party&#8221; and &#8220;La Tromba&#8221;. Wolfgang Gartner is a producer who is featuring in almost every podcast and this month he&#8217;s given us a hot rework of MSTRKRFT&#8217;s &#8220;Heartbreaker&#8221;. Following that we&#8217;ve got a fantastic remix of the new Basement Jaxx track &#8220;Raindrops&#8221; by Funkagenda and Paul Thomas. Check out the wicked breakdown and vocoded vocals!

Australia&#8217;s TV Rock give us a hot house tune &#8220;In The Air&#8221; which Axwell has remixed into a tune which should have been called &#8220;Hands In The Air&#8221;!! An awesome remix as always by the hard-working Swede. I then threw a couple of old school sounding house tunes in the mix as I&#8217;m really enjoying the old piano tracks. First up is the new track from Benny Royal who takes us on an old school piano journey with &#8220;Pada Papaya&#8221;. Then we&#8217;ve got a hot new track from Barcelona&#8217;s The Requesters and their track &#8220;Chrisis&#8221;. A new school version of an old school rave track with cut-up pianos and old school samples. I love the bassline on it too! Awesome!

To end this month&#8217;s show I&#8217;ve gone a bit more pumping with a deep and dirty electro house track from Robbie Rivera. I love the horns and spoken word vocal on his track &#8220;Move Move&#8221;. After that is a cheeky reworking of Baby D&#8217;s &#8220;Let Me Be Your Fantasy&#8221;. He&#8217;s turned the old breakbeat track into a pumping electro house monster. Up next is the new release on Seamus Haji&#8217;s Big Love label called &#8220;I&#8217;ve Been Looking&#8221;. As always Seamus Haji turns out a fantastic track with a killer progressive house remix from French producer Romain Curtis.

There was only one artist that I could choose for this month&#8217;s Cruze classic after the sad passing of Michael Jackson back in June 2009. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of his music and the house remix of &#8220;Smooth Criminal&#8221; by Brothers In Rhythm was always a huge track for me back in the day. Plenty of funky drums, police sirens and the massive bassline and vocals help this to be a great remix. Enjoy!

I hope you like the tracks on this month&#8217;s show and don&#8217;t forget to comment below and tell me what you think of them.
