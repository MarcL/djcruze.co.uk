Time for another hour of funky and chunky house music from the crates of the DJ Cruze studio with episode #54 of the DJ Cruze Podcast. This show is another great one and this month I&#8217;ve gone on more of a disco tip to start off. It seems like the disco cut-up is back in fashion with some awesome tunes from the likes of Fake Blood (aka DJ Touche), Duck Sauce (aka Armand Van Helden and ex DMC World Champion DJ A-Trak), Tee Sky and Ou Est La Swimming Pool.

Kicking off the show is a track which I really can&#8217;t get out of my head. It came out a couple of months ago but Boy 8-Bit&#8217;s &#8220;Baltic Pine&#8221; is a huge track in that folk-house vein which was popular last year. Lovely skippy drums and a cheeky sample make it a winner for me. Fake Blood gives us his massive &#8220;Fix Your Accent&#8221; EP and I couldn&#8217;t resist sticking two of the tracks from it in the mix as Touche is an awesome producer.

There are some fantastic non-disco tracks in the mix too in case it all gets too 90s for you! Wolfgang Gartner is back with another dirty slice of electro house with his new track &#8220;Fire Power&#8221;. There&#8217;s a massive new tune from top German house producer Eddie Thoneick featuring Andy P on vocals. We&#8217;ve also got the huge track &#8220;How Soon Is Now&#8221; from David Guetta, Sebastian Ingrosso and Dirty South. It&#8217;s a massive electro house track with a huge breakdown. After that I&#8217;ve got the Chris Lake remix of &#8220;San Francisco&#8221; by Italian producer Lys which I didn&#8217;t manage to squeeze onto last month&#8217;s podcast. It takes a while to build up but the breakdown is huge!

The penultimate track is something a bit different for the podcast. It&#8217;s Phonat&#8217;s dubstep remix of the Sharooz track &#8220;Adrenalize&#8221;. The original track is a huge, pumping electro house track but it didn&#8217;t quite do it for me and the Phonat mix, although not strictly a house tune, just hit the spot for me. It&#8217;s something a bit different so let me know if you&#8217;re feeling the track or not.

The Cruze Classic this month takes me back to my breakbeat roots with the 1991 breakbeat classic &#8220;Way In My Brain&#8221; by SL2. It was always a massive track when I dropped it down to that big, dubby bassline and awesome synth stabs. An awesome track!

I hope you like the tracks on this month&#8217;s show and don&#8217;t forget to comment below and tell me what you think of them.
