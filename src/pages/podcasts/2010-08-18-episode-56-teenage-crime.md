I'm back again with some more funky and chunky house music for your listening pleasure. A bit later than I expected (come on, you know me well enough by now!) but we'll eventually get back to the regular monthly podcast schedule!

So yet again we've got some massive tunes from the Balkan vibes of Riva Starr, through deep and techy house, back to banging electro house and some hands-in-the-air piano anthems too. The big tunes for me this month are Patric La Funk's awesome track &#8220;Next To You (Sweat)&#8221; which kicks off on the tech house vibe but wait for the piano vocal breakdown. Absolutely massive! Marco Lys is rocking my floors as always with his jacking remix of the Full Intention classic &#8220;America (I Love America)&#8221;. I'm loving the drum programming on this one – great percussion and nice, skippy drums. Finally, we've got the dancefloor anthem, and name of this month's podcast, &#8220;Teenage Crime&#8221; by Sweden's Adrian Lux. Remixed by Axwell and Henrik B, this starts off all mean and moody and then builds to an epic breakdown with a brilliant vocal. I can't stop singing this one!

The Cruze Classic for this month is a bit newer than usual, coming out in 2003. It's the Darren Emerson remix of the Gus Gus track &#8220;David&#8221;. It's a killer house track which still rocks my dancefloors now. A tough and jacking bassline, some lovely vocals from Gus Gus and a big horn-style synth breakdown make it a winner in my box. If you like this remix then check out [King Britt's remix][2] too for something a bit deeper but still damn funky.

I hope you like the tracks on this month's show and don't forget to comment below and tell me what you think of them. You can also get hold of me on [Twitter][3] and I've created an [official DJ Cruze Facebook fan page][4] too. Go and &#8220;Like&#8221; me!
