Hello! How are you? It's been a long time hasn't it?

If you're an old friend then welcome back. If you're new to [DJ Cruze](/about) then it's great to see you here.

It's been a long time coming but, after 10 years of saying I was going to do it, I have rebuilt the website.

So why have I been away for so long? Read on...

### A brief history of the last 10 years

A lot has happened since I last updated the old site in 2011. My DJing career slowed down a lot due to family commitments. My wife and I had children towards the end of the 2000s and having young children and staying up late and partying don't go together well. And then in 2014, [I nearly died](https://marclittlemore.com/how-i-almost-died). I contracted an infection which caused sepsis. I found myself in intensive care for while and had to rebuild my life. It's a long story so read about what happened if you're interested and then come back.

The next two years were spent recovering. I had a lot of health issues and had zero energy for DJing or music making. I had to focus on getting better and learning to live past a major health scare.

I spent a few years recovering from being really ill and didn't really have the energy for DJing. I was still listening to a lot of new music but I was still learning to live again after being so ill so DJing wasn't high on my list of priorities. Life carried on and I got used to a "new normal".

My good friend and DJing partner-in-crime, Mark Wyss aka DJ Vuish, continued to have his legendary house parties and he encouraged me to DJ again. It was tricky at times as I was unable to stand for long periods of time, and I lacked the stamina to DJ all night like the old days, all due to my health problems. I spin a few tunes at his parties and still loved it though!

Mark and I decided to revive our DJ partnership with a back-to-back live stream on YouTube in 2017. Sadly copyright issues plagued the mix and YouTube took down the audio! We ended up with a 4 hour stream of two men dancing to no music. I've taken the stream down now but it helped me

And then 2020 happened.
