Hello! How are you? It's been a long time hasn't it?

At long last, the DJ Cruze website is back online and has had an update to bring it into 2020.

A lot has happened since I last touched the site in 2011. My DJing career slowed down a lot due to family commitments and having young children. And then I [nearly died in 2014](https://marclittlemore.com/how-i-almost-died). It's a long story so read about what happened and then come back. I'll wait.

I spent a few years recovering from being really ill and didn't really have the energy for DJing. I was still listening to a lot of new music but I was still learning to live again after being so ill so DJing wasn't high on my list of priorities. Life carried on and I got used to a "new normal".

My good friend and DJing partner-in-crime, Mark Wyss aka DJ Vuish, kept on having parties where I'd spin a few tunes but not like the old days. We did a back-to-back live stream on YouTube in 2017 but a copyright issue means there's no audio now! ðŸ˜†
