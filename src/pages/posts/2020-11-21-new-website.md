Hello! How are you? It's been a long time hasn't it?

If you're an old friend then welcome back. If you're new to [DJ Cruze](/about) then it's great to see you here.

It's been a long time coming but, after 10 years of saying I was going to do it, I have rebuilt this website.

So why have I been away for so long? Read on...

### A brief history of the last 10 years

A lot has happened since I last updated the old site in 2011. My DJing career slowed down a lot due to family commitments. My wife and I had children towards the end of the 2000s and having young children and staying up late and partying don't go together well. And then in 2014, [I nearly died](https://marclittlemore.com/how-i-almost-died). I contracted an infection which caused [sepsis](https://sepsistrust.org/about/about-sepsis/). My body started poisoning itself as an overreaction to the infection and I found myself in intensive care fighting for my life. I spent 3 long months in hospital and had to rebuild my life aftwards. It's a long story so read about what happened on my personal website if you're interested and then come back.

The next two years were spent recovering. I had a lot of health issues and had zero energy for DJing or music making. I had to focus on getting better and learning to live after a major health scare. Bringing back DJ Cruze wasn't high on my list of priorities so I let the website and DJ career go. Life carried on and I had to get used to my "new normal" and the problems that sepsis had caused.

### Finding love for house music again

My good friend and DJing partner-in-crime, Mark Wyss aka DJ Vuish, continued to have his legendary house parties for his birthday. These are a constant in our lives as he still loves to party! We always got back together to drink too many beers and DJ for as long as we could stay awake. He started to encourage me to DJ again. The first party in 2015 was tough. I was unable to stand for long periods of time so I sat on a stool and mixed some tunes for about an hour. I lacked the stamina to DJ all night like the old days. I still loved it though and it made me start thinking about resurrecting my DJ Cruze alter-ego once I was well enough.

Vuish and I decided to revive our DJ partnership with a back-to-back live stream on YouTube in January 2017. It took a while to organise but we spent 4 fantastic hours spinning house tunes on vinyl and CD. Sadly, copyright issues plagued the mix when we streamed it on YouTube. As many streamers find nowadays we had a copyright claim for the final video. Thanks to the [S-Man](https://www.rogersanchez.com/)'s publishing company for not allowing ["Time 2 Stop (9 to 5 Mix)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qekY_11MzQ) be part of the stream! YouTube removed the audio so I ended up with a 4 hour stream of two men dancing to no music. I hadn't recored the audio locally so I couldn't export it to an MP3 mix so I've taken the stream down now. However, it sparked the flame of interest in DJing again.

A few years passed and Mark and thought about another live stream but never managed to find a time to do it.

And then 2020 happened...

### Revival of the DJ stream

As we all know, 2020 has been one hell of a year.

Over here in the UK, the Coronavirus pandemic started becoming prevalent around the end of February and the start of March. I started working from home 100% of the time from the 2nd week in March. Most of the UK locked down a week later and the whole family were confined to the house.

Around this time, an old DJ friend from Manchester, [Dev Chandramani](https://www.facebook.com/dev.chandramani) aka Dev C, started a Facebook group known as [Vinyl Posse](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vinylposse). A collection of like-minded ex-DJs and vinyl lovers got together to discuss tunes and then Dev started some weekly DJ live streams to get us through lockdown.

### Rebuilding djcruze.co.uk

I tried to start a redesign of the DJ Cruze website a few times but never got enough momentum going to finish it. As I now had a lot more experience of the web development world, I had ideas to rebuild it with a [static site generator](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/) rather than using [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). For various geeky technical reasons, this would make life easier. A few false starts of the site lay in my digital graveyard with other side projects.
