I've had so much good feedback about this tune that I'm going to just have to let it loose to the public. It's finally finished and mastered and, even though I do say so myself, it is sounding awesome! I played this mix out at the Loft Club in Germany at the weekend and it went down really well. People keep asking for it so you can download a nice 192 kbps by clicking on the link above.

Just right click on the link and do "save target as" or "save link as" to save it to your PC. I hope you like it. Let me know what you think using the [contact form][1]. Share it with your friends too and spread the DJ Cruze funky house vibe!

I'd like to give big love to Bluethumb and all of the guys and girls on the [Nelly Furtado official forums][2]. He found my remix in my podcast and posted a [link][3] up to the site. They love the remix so that's made me happy! If the Nelly Furtado fans like it then I must be doing something right. Thanks for all of their support and I hope I've done her justice.
