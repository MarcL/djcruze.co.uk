As it is almost Christmas I thought I&#8217;d better give you an early Christmas present and post a link to last year&#8217;s Christmas bootleg. In case you have forgotten, I did a quick and cheeky cut-up version of Nat King Cole&#8217;s fabulous &#8220;The Christmas Song&#8221; on last year&#8217;s [Christmas podcast][1] and it seemed to be enjoyed by a lot of you. It is one of my favourite yuletide songs and it reminds me of being young and getting all excited in the run up to Christmas.

It was a pretty simple bootleg that I did in Ableton Live so don&#8217;t expect anything too fancy! I looped up some samples from The Christmas Song and added some beats, sleigh bells (listen carefully and you&#8217;ll hear them) and a simple synth bassline. This years bootleg might be a bit more funky but first I&#8217;ve got to decide on which track to bastardise. Wham&#8217;s &#8220;Last Christmas&#8221; is a current favourite and Cliff Richard&#8217;s &#8220;Miseltoe and Wine&#8221; is a contender so get ready for some Christmas fun!

I should have posted it up for you earlier in the year (or at the end of last year) but I thought I&#8217;d give it to you now for a bit of festive fun for your office Christmas party. If anyone manages to get their boss to dance to it then I&#8217;d like to see photos!
