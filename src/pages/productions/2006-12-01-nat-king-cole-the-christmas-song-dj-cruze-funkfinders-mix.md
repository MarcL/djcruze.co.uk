As it is almost Christmas I thought I'd better give you an early Christmas present and post a link to last year's Christmas bootleg. In case you have forgotten, I did a quick and cheeky cut-up version of Nat King Cole's fabulous "The Christmas Song" on last year's [Christmas podcast](/podcasts/episode-7-merry-christmas/) and it seemed to be enjoyed by a lot of you. It is one of my favourite yuletide songs and it reminds me of being young and getting all excited in the run up to Christmas.

It was a pretty simple bootleg that I did in Ableton Live so don't expect anything too fancy! I looped up some samples from The Christmas Song and added some beats, sleigh bells (listen carefully and you'll hear them) and a simple synth bassline. This years bootleg might be a bit more funky but first I've got to decide on which track to bastardise. Wham's "Last Christmas" is a current favourite and Cliff Richard's "Miseltoe and Wine" is a contender so get ready for some Christmas fun!

I should have posted it up for you earlier in the year (or at the end of last year) but I thought I'd give it to you now for a bit of festive fun for your office Christmas party. If anyone manages to get their boss to dance to it then I'd like to see photos!
