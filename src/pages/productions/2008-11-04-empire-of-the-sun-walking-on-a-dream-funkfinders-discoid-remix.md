Every now and again I come across a song which really moves me. So I was trawling through the music news on the internet last month and I came across an awesome new tune by Empire Of The Sun called "Walking On A Dream". It's a collaboration between Nick Littlemore (no relation to me!) from the awesome Australian band [Pnau][2] and Luke Steele from another great Australian band [The Sleepy Jackson][3]. It had a cool 80s vibe about it and I just couldn't get the chorus out of my head. As I had been listening to a lot of French filtered house tracks and remixes I started thinking what a great house track it would make if it was looped up and played around with. So I started doing it.

Here you'll find the Funkfinders Discoid remix of Walking On A Dream. I've tried to take it in a Fred Falke direction with funky bass, 80s FM synthesis and some layered electric piano along with some chunky but funky drums. The Empire Of The Sun vocals filter in and out nicely and hopefully you'll find it rocks your dancefloors. [Let me know][4] how it went down if you play it in your DJ sets.

**UPDATE:** There seems to be some audio glitches with this version. So I've removed the download link for now. Will fix it later today (6th November 2008).

**UPDATE 2 (21:28, 6th November 2008):** I've uploaded a new version and checked it out and it seems fine. Please let me know in the comments if you have any more problems. I've also done an edit of it so it's a little bit shorted but it works better.

Listen to the original song and see the video on YouTube:

P.S. Sorry it's a bit late. I meant to post it last weekend! Oh and it probably needs a bit of an edit as it's a bit too long but I'll leave that for you guys to do as I've heard it too many times now! <img src="http://www.djcruze.co.uk/cms/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
